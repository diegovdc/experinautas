<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this interview with composer, author, filmmaker and educator Jack Curtis Dubowsky we talk about live music for film. Everything from what is needed to organize a show involving film and music, to the different techniques (improvisatory, structural etc.) he uses and how he prepares his ensemble for live performance.</p>
<p>For his live music for film, Jack performs with the Jack Curtis Dubowsky Ensemble, combining acoustic instruments, electronic hardware, composed material, and structured improvisation. He is also a composer of orchestral and choral music, and has written on the various intersections of cinema, animation, music, and sexuality. In March 2016 Palgrave MacMillan will be publishing my first monograph, entitled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Intersecting-Queerness-Palgrave-Studies-Audio-Visual/dp/1137454202" target="_blank">Intersecting Film, Music, and Queerness.</a></p>
<h2 id="introduction-live-music-film">An introduction to live music for film</h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: How did you get into doing live music for film?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jack: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started scoring indie films professionally in 2001. I had been working in Pixar’s in-house music department since about 1997, back when the company was in Point Richmond, even before the Emeryville campus. From a practical standpoint, film and media are areas where a composer or musician can get some monetary compensation and work with other interesting, creative people.  Many composers entertain fantasies of meeting some Diaghilev figure and composing ballets and operas.  I was particularly interested in opera.  But, there are just more opportunities for work in film.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started JCDE in 2008.  I wanted my own group to do live performances under my own name, rather than some obfuscating ensemble name.  Doing live music for film was a way to bring in my expertise from the professional world, but furthermore it was a way to bring in filmmakers and a wider audience. We started doing performances incorporating film in 2009 at ATA (Artists Television Access) on Valencia Street in San Francisco. We did films by Samara Halperin and other local filmmakers, and Jean Genet’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chant d’Amour</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  In 2009 we incorporated visuals in our concert at the Meridian Music: Composers in Performance Series at the Meridian Gallery in San Francisco.  I began to introduce some of my own work as a filmmaker into JCDE programming.  In June of 2010 </span><a href="http://www.submergedqueerspaces.com/SQS_Site/Video.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we did a big performance with an early cut of my experimental documentary, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Submerged Queer Spaces, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">at the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">African American Arts and Culture Complex in San Francisco CA as part of the National Queer Arts Festival.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Really, as a composer or ensemble, you will bring in a larger, wider audience in collaboration with filmmakers or with public-domain silent films that people know, like The Golem.  There’s a lot of groups doing live music for film.  It’s something that has a very direct, simple appeal.  Sometimes, with a new music group, it’s difficult to describe what the concert will be like.  But, if you’re doing a live score event, you describe the film, and people get it right away.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: What do you find most constraining and most liberating or inspiring in doing this kinds of shows?</span></i></p>
<p>Jack: <span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important constraint is rights and permissions and clearances.  You have to use a public domain print.  Well, guess what, if a private company like Kino International or Criterion has restored a film, they own that restoration. So you need to get a public domain copy, an unrestored cut of the film.  That, or pay a screening fee.  So, that’s definitely a constraint.  You also need a certain kind of venue, one with a screen or a huge white wall that you can project on.  You cannot just set up and do a show in a bar or café like Classical Revolution.  The venue has to be a good one for projecting a film.  JCDE has its own projector, so it’s not necessary for the venue to have a projector, but they need to have a good place to throw the image.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>I guess what’s most liberating is the constraint of the film itself: by having creative demands put upon you, such as following the narrative of the film, it guides you, but also liberates you.</strong>  You can do whatever you like, as long as it works with the film.  If you have no constraints, it’s like being trapped by having too much freedom.  You don’t know what to worry about.  What should I write?  But by having the film provide a very rigid temporal structure, that gives you the freedom to do whatever you like within that form and structure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The film itself has to be the main inspiration.  So what is inspiring, that would be the film.  You don’t want to select a film that is boring or uninspiring.  It’s easier to do a film that suggests all kinds of musical possibilities.  The Golem is a very complex film, but there’s all kind of gestural acting and complex subplots going on that suggest certain musical approaches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Diego: What characterizes a great live music for film score? And what a performance?</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jack: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a tough question; I can more easily tell you about some terrible ones I’ve seen, without naming names.  There have been some bands and performers from the rock and popular music worlds that have done live scores for films, and while some have been good, some have been terrible because they were stuck in the concept of the “song.”  And by song I mean just that: a binary AB verse-chorus structure in regular 8 or 16 bar patterns. So the opening sequence is one “song.” Then the next scene or two is another “song.”  Or if it’s not a “song,” then it’s a groove or a jam.  And the resulting score is just a chain of “songs,” like when you play Dark Side of the Moon to Wizard of Oz. It’s cool for a while, but after the first 50 minutes, it’s tiresome.  Structurally, films are not a chain of songs, and while you can subdivide a film that way, it’s like trying to force a square peg into a round hole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I guess I’d say <strong>a great live score is one that understands the film, and adds something to the experience.  It helps the audience understand and process the silent film.</strong> As far as performance, the audience is going to watch the screen, not the ensemble, so there’s no need for gratuitous posing or flamboyant soloing. You do what serves the film.  <strong>What makes a great performance is when the players are really well prepared, and know the film really well, so they hit their mark perfectly.  So there’s no hesitation with the improv.</strong>  For example, if an instrument has to represent what a silent film actor is saying or doing gesturally, they need to be right on that, they need to know with confidence where that happens and how they want to play that moment.</span></p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O-qXfG5wbSc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2 id="improvisation-and-film-music">Types of improvisation that are well suited for film</h2>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: How do you use improvisation in this contexts?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jack: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s all kinds of improvisation approaches that we use. Most of it is “structured improvisation,” with the film providing the structure, and the players are free to play anything within certain guidelines dictated by the narrative. I will go over some of the more specific improvisatory techniques that we use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For The Golem, I’ve composed several themes. They are fully notated, and written out in one to three parts.  So in the score I can specify, for example, certain instruments will play “Theme A.”  Or I will have a solo instrument play a fragment of theme A.  The player can choose the fragment themselves and how to play it, what tempo or emphasis or variation of that fragment. Or I might have two instruments play a duet based upon theme A. These are <strong>improvisations, based upon existing melodic material that I have supplied.</strong>  So it gives the player freedom, but also keeps things coherent.  I’m not micro-managing. A good player can come up with a variation of a melody.  And of course we have rehearsals in which a lot of this gets worked out, seeing what works and what doesn’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain<strong> accompanying textures may be completely improvised</strong>. So if we want the sound of wind, or of cold, or of heat, or of fire, certain instruments can do that nicely, and those textures can be specified in the score but then freely improvised by the player.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain <strong>visual gestures can be imitated with music, a technique often called “mickey-mousing.”</strong> It just means a player should follow that onscreen action closely. So if I write for doublebass, “MM Golem footsteps,” the player will hit those footsteps. This “MM” is really effective to do with dialogue, which is often delivered in exaggerated gestures in silent film. In one scene, Miriam is whining to her father, Rabbi Jehuda, who angrily barks back at her.  So these gestures, whining and barking, are easily improvised and imitated by instruments.  There’s no need to write out a precise part for the player; it’s much more fun for the player to improvise this themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One kind of improvisation<strong> I tend to avoid or use sparingly is that sort of jazz or rock improvisation style of playing over preset chord changes.</strong> This tends to fall into what Derek Bailey called “idiomatic” improvisation, and it is often predictable or boring, and harkens back to that jam-band kind of scoring which I dislike. There’s places where it comes in handy, but <strong>I favor free improvisation, structured improvisation, improvisation based upon supplied melodic material, and textural and gestural improvisation.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also, of course, improvisation based upon graphic notation; I tend to use that more in my concert music than I do in live film scores. I think the reason graphic notation is more suited to concert music has to do with available space on the page, page turns, and rehearsal time. Also there’s less of a reason to draw a pictograph when there’s already plenty of visual cuing on the screen already in a film.</span></p>

<h2 id="aspects-of-film-music">Structure, dialogue and other aspects of film music</h2>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How is your work process different when working with films, as opposed to working solely with music?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jack: The compositional process is similar, with the main difference being the handling of form and structure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you study any kind of composition, one of the things you study is form and structure.  This is true whether this is musical composition, poetry, prose, or architecture.  Form and structure is often supplied by established conventions: maybe I’m writing a sonnet, or a sonata, or a theme-and-variations, or an opera.  Maybe I’m writing a TV commercial, or a piece for organ that will unfold over 10 centuries.  In any case, a trained composer will approach a piece with an idea of the form and structure.  It’s like the architect who builds a house, and the first thing he thinks about might not be the façade, but the frame. What holds it up? How big is it?  What’s the pacing or the overall size and shape?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a film, that basic structure comes supplied. You know how long the film is, where the “acts” are dramatically, what are the important scenes, the “tentpoles”, and what is transitional. A film solves most musical problems of form and structure, and allows you to concentrate on other areas, like themes, development, texture, mood, arrangement, and orchestration.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: Besides structure, which aspects of the film do you pay most attention to  when writing the music? And how do you approach each of them? </span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am very sensitive to visual issues and dramatic issues. What needs emphasis? Where are the storylines? What is important? What needs to be indicated?  For example, in The Golem, Miriam is looking dreamily out the window.  Unless we are really paying attention, or have watched the film a hundred times, we might miss that she is looking at her lover Florian, offscreen, in the street below. Playing the love theme can signpost what is going on in her head.  For another example, when Florian shows the Emperor’s seal to the guard at the ghetto gate, the audience might not understand that the seal belongs to the Emperor and that’s what gives Florian the ability to travel wherever he wants. So, the Emperor’s theme can indicate that. Music will remind the audience where the seal comes from and its political importance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a tendency to approach these moments with what are called “tropes,” or basic musical gestures the audience understands. These tropes go back to opera, to theatre music, to the troubadours and storytelling, they are very old and recognizable. Everyone has heard pizzes used for tip-toes sneaky music, and agitato chase music, for example. You can approach things in so many ways, depending upon what you would like to emphasize. Are we following the action that we can see, or are we indicating that there’s something else happening outside the frame? Are we playing the point of view of one character or another?  Do we need to emphasize emotion, or maybe just the time of day or how cold it is?  Certain scenes might be tonally ambiguous, and you can play things up, or keep them small. There’s just so many approaches, and I think it helps to decide how you want the film to play.  As far as musical approaches, it’s whatever works, whatever is interesting. There should be no limitations musically, as long as it’s working with the film.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you always see the music as supporting the film or do you aim at establishing other types of relationships to it, producing music which might at times diverge from the film&#8217;s intentions (commenting, contradicting, etc.)?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jack: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First of all, there’s a huge history of what you describe, going back to the “film funners” of the silent period, as described in Rick Altman’s important book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silent Film Sound</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  These were cinema accompanists, typically organists and pianists, who specialized in making fun of a film by accompanying it with comedic music, much like the “Mystery Science Theatre” television program. So instead of supporting the film, they were trying to tear it down and make the audience laugh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider also </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dark Side of the Rainbow</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the legendary underground VHS tape and DVD that post-synchronizes Pink Floyd’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dark Side of the Moon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wizard of Oz</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  It’s cute and clever, but it gets pretty tiresome once the album needs to start repeating itself to cover the length of the film.  The first few reels are pretty fascinating though, and show us how independent narrative structures of concept album and feature film can surprisingly align temporally just by chance or happy accident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also an academic notion or theory of ‘counterpoint’ in music for visual media, which is to say, music that goes unexpectedly against the visual, for example scoring a combat scene not with action music, but with sad music; there’s a well-known example of this in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Platoon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  So the film becomes a commentary on the horror of war, rather than a typical action movie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Golem</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we are treating the film entirely with respect.  There’s little funny moments in it, but overall we are trying to support the film, not undermine it.  </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Golem </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is powerful cinema, and our intention is to support Paul Wegener’s original vision and to help communicate the story effectively to the audience, whether or not they have seen the film before.  Since it’s a public domain film, there’s a version of it online that has some pretty random classical music dumped in everywhere, and that version of the film makes little sense, because the music is so meaningless or confounding. <strong> We are trying to make the film come alive by having appropriate music, music that works with the film.</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Diego: And about ensembles, what kinds of instrumentation do you think are better for live music for film, and which size of an ensemble would you suggest as ideal (if any)?</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s driven by a number of variables, as you might expect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One is the performance space: how many players can it hold, what is the set up there? Do they have a projector and a screen, where are those, or if we bring in our own gear, where does it need to go?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another is budget. Not only in terms of money per player, but also in terms of the number of “services,” how many rehearsals there can be based upon time and money, and how much rehearsal time there is available.  A larger ensemble might need more rehearsal time, or they might just need a simpler score, in the same way that large ensemble music differs from chamber music.  Things that are complex, virtuosic, or more specific to a particular technique will warrant more rehearsal time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JCDE, pretty early in our inception, did concerts at ATA in San Francisco that just were two players: Fred Morgan on drums and percussion, and myself on Roland Jupiter 6 analogue synthesizer and electric bass.  That was pretty minimal; so live music for film can be done with a small ensemble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instrumentation depends on the film, but I’m also thinking about what </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">types</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of players to bring in on a show.  For </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Golem</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we need players that can improvise in the techniques and styles I’ve described above.  For </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Golem</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we also benefit from clarinet, which can invoke a klezmer sound, and can also imitate a shofar, which is necessary as it appears visually in the film.  Our clarinetist, Alicia Byer, does this amazing job of imitating a shofar on a clarinet, you cannot tell that it’s not the real thing.  It’s absolutely unbelievable.  Trade secret!  </span></p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hAHv-znlAXg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2 id="rehearsal–and-performance">Rehearsal and Performance</h2>
<p><em>Diego: How does your rehearsals look like?</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our rehearsal schedule depends upon if the piece has been done before and the familiarity of the players with the piece.  When we first debuted </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Golem</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in March 2015, we had three rehearsals.  The first rehearsal was meant to just get through the whole thing, stopping any time when needed, trying out different approaches in rough spots, and making sure everything worked.  So the first rehearsal is about getting people familiar with the score, making sure everything works, and settling on the approach we will take for every moment of the film. The second rehearsal we attempt to get through the whole thing without stopping, but likely stopped a few times and ironed out some rough patches.  The third rehearsal was a dress rehearsal. No stopping, no fixing, going through the whole show. Afterwards we might have hit some spots, but the main thing in a dress rehearsal is to run through the whole show.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we do repeat performances, we will have fewer rehearsals.</span></p>
<p><em>Diego: How do you prepare a performance (where is the best place to set the ensemble, how do you dress, interaction with the audience, etc.)?</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For live music to projected cinema, concert black is a good way to go.  We all have stand lights, and otherwise the only light should be from the screen. You don’t want to block the screen for the audience, but you also want to preserve good sight lines so the ensemble can see each other and see the screen as well.  That’s particularly important for the “mickey-mousing” improvisation that needs to synchronize tightly on screen action.  If physical space in the venue allows, we tend to go on either side of the screen, facing the screen, and facing each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s generally not much audience interaction, although sometimes we can get the audience to scream during the onscreen earthquake, for example. Although it is a live music event, primarily people are coming to see the film and want to engage with the film.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Golem</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we all wore these tall, black, pointy hats, as you might be able to see in some of our PR photos that were taken</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">t the show at HM157 in March, 2015.  That’s because the Jews in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Golem</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, at least all the men, all are wearing these big black hats, and we thought that would be a fun thing to do, to have us be kind of “part” of the film visually as well as musically.  When we walk out on stage, some people might get it right away, and then everyone will certainly get it once they see the film.  For me, Alicia gave me this crazy “wizard” hat to wear, and, I don’t want to give anything away, but it really complemented the film.</span></p>
<p><em>Diego: What is the most important thing (or things) to keep in mind when doing live music for film?</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re doing it to enhance the film.  If you are a band, don’t play a bunch of your songs and use the film as a pretty backdrop. I mean, you can, but then you have Pink Floyd.  I love Pink Floyd, but, most bands are not Pink Floyd. Support the film. Know the film. Every detail. Understand the film.</span></p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YCVpI6WgwCM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>
<p><em>Diego: Are there any musicians or composers that you would consider as important references for musicians engaging in live music for film?</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_cBzuFyx-c" target="_blank">Clubfoot Orchestra</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZkvjWIEcoU" target="_blank">Alloy Orchestra</a> have both been doing this type of program for a long time.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/AFV14KXA_ew?list=PLfEoPk1dqwLMc_9CZP9e-HMei_Y4I4jM6" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuxedo Moon did a very nice score to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pink Narcissus</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that is available limited edition on LP; I’ve not seen their live score for the film, but the music is very textured and sensitive and enjoyable.</span></p>
<p><em>Diego: What musician(s) would you like to recommend?</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jack:Tough question, because I think people should discover things for themselves, or if one makes recommendations, one should do that based upon knowledge of the particular needs of the recommendee, what it is they are missing from their collection. <a href="https://newamsterdamrecords.bandcamp.com/music" target="_blank">New Amsterdam Records</a>, <a href="https://bedroomcommunity.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Bedroom Community Records</a>, almost anything out of Iceland or Brooklyn, those are the correct answers right now. You have to know what these folks are doing because they have momentum. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYpkGvtZzbM" target="_blank">Mason Bates</a>, <a href="https://nicomuhly.bandcamp.com/album/mothertongue" target="_blank">Nico Muhly</a>, those are among the rising stars of today’s generation. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTlGnhGYXHw" target="_blank">Bang on a Can</a>, who have been around for a long time now, started a movement towards collectives that is now realized in other groups like <a href="http://wildup.la/" target="_blank">WildUp in Los Angeles</a>. There is a lot going on, and often it’s not a particular musician, but groups of musicians who share affiliations geographically or structurally through these organizations.  <a href="https://youtu.be/LRQBoIYMvu8" target="_blank">There’s a smaller group here in LA called WasteLAnd and they have been doing interesting shows</a>; one of their directors,<a href="https://populistrecords.bandcamp.com/album/scott-worthington-prism" target="_blank"> bassist Scott Worthington, just released a beautiful new solo CD called </a></span><a href="https://populistrecords.bandcamp.com/album/scott-worthington-prism" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prism</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which is on <a href="https://populistrecords.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Populist Records, a boutique label that promotes new music.</a> I also would recommend going to a used record store and buying a bunch of old LPs with covers you like.  If the album or its music is not posted on YouTube, buy it. So much important music has never been re-released on CD or digitally, for example early electronic music on Nonesuch or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTU3h92xXOw" target="_blank">improvisatory chamber music by Lukas Foss</a>, and so on.  There’s tons of important “new music” and avant-garde and experimental music out there waiting to be discovered and re-discovered.  But just to reiterate, it’s really difficult for me to make recommendations unless I know someone, as a student or a friend, and know where their head is at.  I think our appreciation of the arts is very unique, and I don’t think everyone needs to like the same thing, and everyone has certain areas where they don’t adequately know the rep, myself included.  It’s great to talk about music and art and culture with people and discover gaps in knowledge and new areas for discovery.</span></p>
<p><b></b><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: How about books?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jack: I read so much, I go through a lot of stuff, I have quite a library. If there are students reading this, I’d recommend, when you are starting out, you need a good orchestration book, and you need to write in it all your observations in your own words, about what works and what doesn’t.  You should annotate your orchestration book so it makes sense to you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently I’m reading Sheppard’s biography of Brian Eno. That has got me to go back and listen to tons of Eno and to complete my collection. Especially I’ve been enjoying his collaborations with German musicians, such as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOCSkXzLRJs" target="_blank">Cluster &amp; Eno</a></span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGhsBmKvaQA" target="_blank">After The Heat</a></span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, even more so since Dieter Moebius died this year, sadly, a great musician and a great innovator. Also </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIkN8DnYh9E" target="_blank">Musik von Harmonia</a></span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. All that music bridges so many approaches and is so under-appreciated.  Also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ6beji4I4" target="_blank">Gavin Bryars, I got a copy of his </a></span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ6beji4I4" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homages</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ6beji4I4" target="_blank"> LP</a>, and it is brilliant.  He’s also connected to<a href="http://boingboing.net/2015/02/13/listen-to-all-ten-albums-from.html" target="_blank"> Eno through the Obscure label</a>, although you may know him through </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT0wonCq_MY" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jesus’ Blood, </span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT0wonCq_MY" target="_blank">his piece for tape and orchestra</a>.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span id="introduction">[Introduction]</span></h2>
<p>Experimental musician, drum machine expert manipulator, creator, podcaster, blogger, and curator. Matt Davignon has been a long time member of the San Francisco Bay Area&#8217;s creative music scene. Through his drum machines, electronic processes, field recording, and samples, he is known for creating a uniquely expressive, dreamlike and psychedelic sound world which is often inspired by organic life.</p>
<p>In this interview we talk about a wide variety of topics, ranging from his creative process for albums and remixes, to how he creates his unique drum machine sound palette, to his thoughtful and illuminating ideas on aesthetics, improvisation, and curation. All in all a very complete interview with one of the most active and involved members of the Bay Area&#8217;s experimental music community.</p>

<h2><span id="creative-process">[Creative process]</span></h2>
<p>Diego Villaseñor: Your recordings have a very strong focus on a single idea, for example, &#8220;The 3am music&#8221; revolves around the theme of sleep and &#8220;Living Things&#8221; focuses on sounds reminiscent or inspired by organic forms of life. Also, both of them inhabit very different sonic worlds. What is your starting point when you decide to work on a new album? How do you proceed afterwards? Can you talk about your process in general terms?</p>
<p>Matt Davignon:  <b>Most of the albums I do come out as a result of having a lot of recordings from live shows and practices at home. I have a process where I pick out things that sound like songs, and I&#8217;ll listen to them occasionally over the period of several months. After a period of time, I&#8217;ll have a few hours of different songs, and I&#8217;ll start to get a sense of the album theme around them</b>. Organic life is one of my favorite themes. A lot of my stuff has that inspiration. &#8220;The 3am Music&#8221; was originally going to be two different albums &#8211; a quiet drone-based one and one inspired by old mechanical equipment left in sheds.</p>
<p>The Oa project already had a theme in how the music was made, so when compiling that CD we simply picked songs that we thought played well together.</p>
<figure id="attachment_98" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/10527430_10152149554830544_8333189173290903386_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-98" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/10527430_10152149554830544_8333189173290903386_n-300x225.jpg" alt="Oa at the Luggage Store Gallery" width="300" height="225" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/10527430_10152149554830544_8333189173290903386_n-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/10527430_10152149554830544_8333189173290903386_n-128x96.jpg 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/10527430_10152149554830544_8333189173290903386_n.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Oa at the Luggage Store Gallery</figcaption></figure>
<p>We actually left a song out because it pointed towards a theme that we didn&#8217;t want to have.</p>
<p>I have a CD coming out later this year called &#8220;Pink Earth&#8221;. In that case I was getting ready for a performance at the annual Garden of Memory event at the Chapel of the Chimes. My practice sessions and live recordings revolved around the theme of reverence for a place of faith and respect for the people who are interred there. Over the following months, the recordings kept the theme of reverence, but started to develop a theme of exploring a strange new natural environment.</p>
<p>Diego: So could it be said that you have two different approaches? One in which you go from a collection of materials upon which you set to discover a theme, and then you proceed to organize, modify or create sounds around it. And then another in which you start from a theme and the proceed to make music directly related to it. Is that so?</p>
<p>Matt: Much more frequently it’s the first approach, where I discover a theme in my existing recordings, then proceed, modify and create sounds (new recordings) around it. <b>I’ve learned that if I try to develop the theme too concretely as the first step, then it doesn’t feel as natural to try to shoehorn a lot of my musical output into that theme.</b></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span id="aesthetics">[Aesthetics: Sound Sources And Sound Design]</span></h2>
<p>Diego: What role does the sound sources play in relation to the theme?</p>
<p>Matt: That’s a tricky one. To me, sound sources play a big role in my identity as a musician, but not necessarily to the theme. It’s not terribly important to me that “Living Things” and <a href="https://mattdavignon.bandcamp.com/album/the-3am-music" target="_blank">“The 3am Music” were made with 100% drum machine</a>. On the other hand, it becomes intrinsic to the non-stated themes of the record. <b>A drum machine processed to sound like a cello or an ant colony doesn’t quite sound like either a drum machine, a cello, or an ant colony. I think that in-between-ness becomes its own theme.</b></p>
<p>With “Pink Earth”, I’m using voice on a solo album for the first time. I’m not sure if the voice becomes a theme until you do something specific with it. On this album, you’ll hear sounds that are immediately recognizable as vocalization, but the changes in pitch, timbre and dynamics aren’t always following the patterns made by a human throat. I imagine that some absent part of the brain wonders, “What animal did that come from?” <b>I find this synthesis between familiar and non-familiar elements to be a fascinating world to play in.</b></p>
<p>Diego: In a way you seem to work on extending the common notions (yours and possibly the listener´s) about certain objects: living things, insomnia, the voice or a drum machine. Then they become something else than what they were supposed to be.  How did you arrive to this fascination (or in other words what do you think prompted you to conceive your music making in such a way)?</p>
<p>Matt: I do love changing the expected properties of sounds to allow for possibilities. For me personally,<b> it’s about discovering a range of possibilities that isn’t commonly explored on an instrument.</b> A piano has the very expected sound of a mallet hitting a string, with a certain attack and decay pattern. There are tens of thousands of pianists playing with just that sound. There’s a lot of variety, but it’s well-explored in most genres. “Prepared” pianists have found acoustic means of giving pianos a wider range of expression. While there is a decent number of prepared pianists, they still make up a small percentage of pianists, so to me they seem to have a lot more freedom to find something new.</p>
<p>Electronic processing and sampling technology has evolved in leaps and bounds over the last 20 years. It’s opened up paths for musicians to take instruments and sounds out of their previously-understood contexts, and to create new things that have to be heard to be imagined.</p>
<p>When I started playing drum machine, my intention wasn’t necessarily to redefine how people thought of drum machines. Ikue Mori already legitimized the drum machine as an improvisation and performance instrument long before me. I was looking for an instrument that I could play with one hand, so my remaining hand and two feet could be used to modify the sounds. The idea that I could tune a drum machine chromatically to play melodies made it even more appealing. <b>The combination between drum machine and processing devices was wonderfully responsive to the directions where I wanted to take sounds &#8211; I could change pitch and volume like traditional instruments, but I could also make sounds more porous, deep, delicate, swarming, layered, etc, and move back and forth between all these properties as easily as I could change notes. It allowed me to discover who I am musically, in a way that I couldn’t personally find with more traditional instruments.</b></p>
<p>Diego: Is that why you said that sound sources play an important role in your identity as a musician?</p>
<p>Matt: Hmmm, maybe it’s more accurate for me to say it’s the treatment of sound sources. Before drum machine, when people asked what instrument I played, I responded that I modify sounds.</p>
<p>Diego: That’s a very good answer. <a href="http://music.arts.uci.edu/dobrian/CMC2009/Liberation.pdf" target="_blank">It reminds me of Varèse calling himself a<img class="  wp-image-100 alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/72525_466816983248_4527002_n-300x225.jpg" alt="72525_466816983248_4527002_n" width="425" height="319" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/72525_466816983248_4527002_n-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/72525_466816983248_4527002_n-128x96.jpg 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/72525_466816983248_4527002_n.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" /> &#8220;a worker in rhythms, frequencies, and intensities.” </a>Now, you mention on your site that field recordings are an important source of inspiration, can you tell me about it?</p>
<p>Matt: Field recordings were one of my instruments between 2000 and 2003. I would collect them on a little cassette recorder, and for a live show, I’d manipulate 4 of these small tape machines in real time. There were no effects at all &#8211; just playing tape and doing the things you can do with tape.</p>
<p>That got me thinking about all the things that happen in a note if you think of a note as a single musical gesture. <b>On most musical instruments, a note is fairly simple: a single attack-sustain-decay-release (ASDR) pattern and a recognizable pitch. With field recordings, a single gesture could have all sorts of different events in it.</b> Even if your recording is of something simple like a church bell, you probably have environmental artifacts in your sound: birds, wind, people, etc. I was also fascinated by the linearity of it. If you draw how a simple piano note sounds out, you’ll get something like a simple water wave shape. If you draw out the peaks and valleys of a few seconds of field recording, it looks more like the horizon of a landscape or cityscape.</p>
<p>As I moved away from field recordings, I wanted the option to keep that richness in sounds, while gaining the ability to play more melodically. On one hand, I started using a volume pedal or various effects to give more complex or unpredictable ASDR shapes. I also started playing in a way that imitates natural sound elements &#8211; single events and pitched or non-pitched clusters that appear irregularly over a . <a href="https://mattdavignon.bandcamp.com/album/living-things" target="_blank">You’ll hear this in the tracks “Freshwater Hydra” and “Blind Cave Tetra” on “Living Things”</a>, and quite a bit of “The 3am Music”.</p>
<p>Diego: So in a sense, your way of listening and of understanding sound events was transformed by listening closely to field recordings, right? <strong>No longer a note or a sound event was a single clean human-made sound but rather, the complex conjunction of a diversity of sound sources. And then the stringing of ordinary notes in a melody was substituted by the stringing of more complex events, like a fusion between melodic construcción and soundscapes: ordinary human tones-music in conjunction with the way in which environments sound.</strong> Am I on the right track?</p>
<p>Matt: Yes, hopefully if I’m doing it right, that’s what it sound like.</p>
<p>Diego: Are there any other sources of inspiration that have helped shape your sonic world (in a similar way as soundscapes did)?</p>
<p>Matt: A few other things.<b> I often want my music to represent a sort of coherent unpredictability that is inspired by organic life. </b></p>
<p>Another one comes from equipment. The first live looping devices I used did not let you set start and end points to your samples, so the loops would have weird hiccups in the. Instead of 4/4, they’d often be something like 5.23. <b>I came to like that, and started trying to work rhythmic imperfections into music sometimes. </b></p>
<p>Lastly and most obviously are the musical inspirations. Since I was a teenager, I was taken with musicians who established instantly-recognizable sound identities for themselves on their instruments. Adrian Belew and Jon Hassell are good examples. I also really enjoyed the work of Klaus Schulze, who was able to do well-layered live electronic music in the 70’s from his bank of synths, organs and tape machines. <b>Coil and Nine Inch Nails were also influences for the way that they created unusual sounds in musical contexts.</b></p>

<p>Diego: Can you talk about your rig and how do you use it to achieve this sounds?</p>
<p>Matt: I made a video a few years ago about my drum machine rig: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ELCrrMdphk" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ELCrrMdphk</a></p>
<p>It’s still about 85% accurate.</p>
<p>My current solo rig is for drum machine and voice.</p>
<p>The voice samples are pre-recorded to USB on a Numark NDX-400 digital turntable. The singing samples are of me singing a single note, looped so that it goes on continuously for about 2-3 minutes. All the pitch changes come from me using the turntable.</p>
<p>On the drum machine, I mostly use either kits where the same sound is tuned chromatically across all the pads, or the sounds on the pads have a similar nature (such as cowbells, tablas &amp; woodblocks with short decays).</p>
<p>Both the turntable and the drum machine go through a series of fx devices:</p>
<p>&#8211;Boss Dr. Sample SP-303 (mostly used for pitch bending or filtering. Very rarely for actual sampling.)</p>
<p>&#8211;Digitech DF-7 Distortion Factory (for distortion/fuzz)</p>
<p>&#8211;Electro-Harmonix Micro-Synthesizer (for more distortion and some filtering)</p>
<p>&#8211;Alesis Philtre (for hi-pass or lo-pass filtering)</p>
<p>&#8211;Alesis Amplitron (for dual tremolo effects)</p>
<p>&#8211;Volume Pedal</p>
<p>&#8211;Electro-Harmonix Super-Ego (This makes an instant drone from anything it hears)</p>
<p>&#8211;Alesis Ineko (usually used for reverb)</p>
<p>&#8211;Two DOD-DFX94 digital delay pedals</p>

<p>After that, I split it up into A and B chains for looping. One chain goes to Looperlative LP-2 looping pedal. The other goes to an Electro-Harmonix Memory Man with Hazarai. The outputs of these then go to a mixer, where I can control the volumes separately.</p>
<p>When playing with Oa, I take out the drum machine and the Super-Ego, and replace it with a Korg Micro-Sampler. The sampler is pre-loaded with a few banks of different people speaking various fragments of words. Also in Oa, I use a wider array of samples on the digital turntable, which feature multiple people speaking or singing.</p>

<h2><span id="remixing">[Remixing Experimental Music]</span></h2>
<p>Diego: It&#8217;s interesting to see that <b>you are using some of the main tools of the remix culture and somehow doing something completely different: instead of mixing elements of different styles of music you are mixing heterogeneous elements from the sound world, voices, environments, animal behaviors, musical instruments and machine &#8220;malfunctions&#8221;, etc. I think it speaks very powerfully about the power of both these tools and the core idea of remix. </b>You recently released a record with remixes of your own music by other artists and even yourself. How did the idea of such and album came about? And how did it enriched or modified the way in which you relate to the whole experience and culture of remixing?</p>
<p>Matt: I’ve always been interested in the act of remixing since I started working with CDs as source material in the mid 90s. My first remixes were for a compilation CD called “CT Project West Coast”. In 2003, <a href="https://mattdavignon.bandcamp.com/album/charcoal-ep" target="_blank">I also released an EP called “Charcoal”, which is technically 5 tracks of me remixing my first CD “5 Spots”</a>. Currently, “Charcoal” is still available, but “5 Spots” is not.</p>
<p>I’ve also done remixes for German artist Michael Peters and the experimental Christian hip-hop group Soul Junk.</p>
<p>I had never thought of doing a project of other people remixing my work until it was repeatedly suggested by my friend<a href="http://www.edgetonerecords.com/grabmiller.html" target="_blank"> Lance Grabmiller</a>.  Up until that point, I didn’t think others would be interested in remixing my work. After putting out a couple feelers on Facebook, I found the interest was there and it came together rather smoothly. I was very happy with the results, <b>I love the community aspect of it: artists sharing their musical impressions and responses to another artist’s work. I wish that more experimental artists did remix albums so that I could contribute to a few. </b></p>
<p>Diego: That&#8217;s certainly a very good idea. How do you approach the remix project?</p>
<p>Matt: As a remixer, my goal is to create something new that sounds both like the original artist, and like me. (Sounds like what every remixer does, right?) <b>I almost always use only material from the original artist, but I frequently use elements from several different songs in the same remix. </b></p>
<p>Other than that, <b>my approach</b> <b>is this</b>:</p>
<p>I’ll put the CD (or digital file) in the player, and play around with making simple loops at various speeds until I get something that I feel I can build on. Usually I stick to fairly pure notes and gestures. I’ll record that loop into my digital audio workstation for a few minutes, sometimes with a little manipulation so it doesn’t feel so repetitive. Then I’ll go back add more layers of different samples of the source material. These may be digital turntable again, or keyboard sampler or sometimes I’ll even transfer some sounds to cassette for tape manipulation. I like to treat the samples as instruments that can be played. Before my old-school CD player died, I liked to try to use the CD skipping/search function to add rhythmic elements. The whole process is very improvisational, except I can throw away things that aren’t working. After several passes, I’ll go back and mix the levels to structure it into something with a beginning, middle and end. There should be a name for this process &#8211; maybe I just don’t know what it is. How about <b>multi-track improvisation</b>?</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span id="daws">[Tips For Working With DAWs, And Improvising Over Pre-recorded Material]</span></h2>
<p>Diego: I have always struggled with improvising over prerecorded material, especially when it is also improvised,  I am intrigued, how do you make it work? Do you also do that when working for music that is not a remix?</p>
<p>Matt: I sometimes struggle with it too. So far with this strategy, the original track is either a loop of some sort, or has a loosely live-played repeating theme. The improvised stuff on top isn’t as free as solo improv. I play over the track a couple of times before I try to actually record it. I rarely keep the first take. However, I try to keep it on the loose side, and avoid getting into any kind of locked in groove.</p>
<p>It’s been a long time since I’ve done any <b>multi-tracked music</b> that wasn’t a remix. With the exception of a collaboration I did with <a href="https://rafter.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Rafter Roberts</a>, none of it has ever been released on anything official. <b>When I first started, it was my main method of music making. Then, about the time I discovered the SF free-improvisation scene, I also made the transition from 4-track cassette to digital recording via computer. While the results were much cleaner, it now took me much longer to finish a song. And I was much happier with the stuff that was free-improvised.</b> I plan to devote more time to digital multi-track recording for future projects, but I think the secret to getting it to work for me is learning to be more informal with it. To treat it more like a 4-track.</p>
<p>Diego: Do you mean, because of the limitations of 4-track recording?</p>
<p>Matt: In a way. When I transitioned to a <b>digital workstation (DAW)</b>, it came with all these tools you can use to clean up the audio. You can easily edit out mistakes, or remove any tape/room/line noise, or compress to get the levels louder. In order to save on hard drive space, it’s tempting to record loops and copy/paste the loops into compositions. It’s tempting to use all of these bells and whistles, but I found myself doing more of this track admin work than actually recording music. After years of leaving it alone, <b>I’m recently discovering I can be more productive if I record a track, adjust volume levels, then go back and do the second track, etc.. Don’t worry about polishing it up until all the tracks are done.</b></p>
<p>Diego: It seems that the more tools one has at his disposal, the more at risk one is at doing nothing but admin work.  What tools do you normally use and which ones do you prefer to avoid?</p>
<p>Matt: That’s certainly the way it works for me. <b>When doing remix work or new work, the only computer stuff I do is multi tracking, noise reduction, compression, and volume envelopes.</b> Even with my CDs being mostly based on live work, I’ve used quite a bit of editing on the last two to keep long tracks from dragging on too long.</p>
<p>Most people I know who use DAWs for composition really thrive with them. I do not. <b>I like to dial up effects in real time to find the exact right setting. I haven’t figured out how to do that in my DAW, and admittedly it hasn’t been a big priority. So most of my sound design happens before the sounds get into the computer.</b></p>
<p>Diego: What other processes or ways of doing things have you found that help you concentrate better in the creative aspects of your work and efficient?</p>
<p>Matt:<b> A big thing for me is to remove technological obstacles to taking sounds in whatever direction I might want to take them in improvisation.</b> <b>I’d have real-time controls for a set number of parameters,</b> than need to hunt through menus and lists to be able to control a larger number of parameters. <b>Most of my pedals do one specific effect very well, such as filtering.</b></p>

<p>Diego: Did your encounter with the Bay Area’s free-improvisation scene change your way of making music? If so, how?</p>
<p>Matt: Absolutely. Before I moved to SF in 1997, my only experience with the local music scene was a radio show featuring post-industrial music on KPFA (called “No Other Radio Network”, hosted at the time by John Gullak.) <b>When I started going to shows, the majority of the musicians I encountered were doing “non-idiomatic improvisation”. I had fun with that too, and it taught me to be more flexible. </b>At first my live instruments were either found objects, or a combination of turntable, CD and cassette instruments. <b>Working with other musicians got me thinking about the roles different instruments fulfill. In time, I wanted to move away from always being only the source of weird electronic sound in a group. I wanted to have a role that could contribute melodically and rhythmically to a band, without distracting from the tone and intensity of the other musicians. That’s a big part of the process that led me to drum machine. </b></p>
<p><b>The other big change was realizing that I’m a small fish in a very big pond. Meeting lots of people in the community doing very diverse work was at the same time humbling, encouraging and freeing.</b> Humbling because I was meeting lots of people who were way more creative and talented than me. Encouraging because a number of people really liked what I was doing, when I had no idea whether my work would stand up to any sort of criticism. Freeing because even in such a big pool, I don’t often encounter people who think about music-making in quite the same way that I do, and I came to realize that some people wanted to hear more of that approach as much as I like hearing other people’s approaches. Also, in such a big pool, there is freedom to <i>not </i>cover certain bases that I would otherwise feel had to be covered. For example. I don’t have to meet a quota of harsh noise because enough people are doing it better than I would. <b>And</b> <b>those people are open-minded enough that they welcome me into their worlds.</b></p>
<p>Diego: You once mentioned to me that in free improvisation sessions where groups would be formed at random, the ones that attracted you the most were the ones in which the musicians would not try to meet each other in a middle-ground but rather, would emphasize their differences, which resulted either in drawing the other musicians into their “language” or having multiple contrasting styles sounding and interacting simultaneously. Could you elaborate more on this idea?</p>
<p>Matt: This is absolutely something that falls in the realm of “one person’s opinion”, and perhaps it’s a hard thing to explain.<b> One of the main reasons I like experimental &amp; improvised music is that it brings out the individuality of the musicians involved.</b> In most of my experiences, those personalities show most in solo contexts, or one in which a musician is a band leader. Going back to the pond analogy, they would all be in different places of the pond.</p>
<p>Several years ago, I became involved with the idea of organizing sound-shifts &#8211; large scale music festivals where 60 to 100 musicians perform in overlapping shifts. (<a href="http://www.johnberndt.org/" target="_blank">The idea was originated by John Berndt in Baltimore.</a>) Over the course of 3 festivals in 3 years. I came to hear lots of sets where musicians were playing together for the first time. In many of the cases these musicians (myself included) sportfully find a middle ground which avoids many of the sonic hallmarks of where they originally came from. (Is this non-idiomatic improvisation?) Anyway, after hearing so many sets of this middle ground I came to miss all the other areas of the pond that weren’t being played. <b>Sometimes in a great set, one of the musicians sticks to their comfort zone and the other musicians walk all the way over and meet them there. Or all the musicians decide together to go into a strange new place that’s new for all of them.</b> I think that either of these strategies usually requires a bit discussion amongst the musicians beforehand.<b> Maybe I shouldn’t say I don’t like the middle, but I don’t want to hear only the middle.</b></p>
<p>Diego: <b>And going back to the metaphor of the pond which I find to be quite a fortunate one. I think that we could speak of a scene as an ecosystem where different musicians are fulfilling different roles, and each occupying their own niche.</b> Then what becomes important is the way in which each species interacts with the other, and how certain events in the ecosystem open paths through which others might feel compelled to evolve. If we look at it that way, your interest in the resources of the drum machine, as you mentioned before, would be an effect of that. This leads me to believe that it is of the interest of all musicians to keep their ecosystem as dynamic and healthy as possible, to enhance interactivity and the participation of their fellows.</p>
<p>Matt: I think you nailed it pretty well. I would add that I think it’s up to the individuals to determine the best direction to take their craft. I consume a lot more recorded music than live music, so<b> I think the best thing people can do for a healthy pond is to figure out what unique things they can contribute to music, and learn to get those messages across well. </b></p>

<h2><span id="promoting">[Being A Promoter In The Creative Music Community]</span></h2>
<p>Diego: You have also been <a href="/interviews/rent-romus-on-the-san-franciscos-bay-area-experimental-music-scene-and-curating-a-music-series/" target="_blank">an active promoter in the creative music community, co-curating the Luggage Store Gallery Series, along with Rent Romus</a>, as well as a the <a href="http://www.sfemf.org/"> San Francisco Electronic Music Festival</a>. Even more,<a href="http://ribosomematt.podomatic.com/" target="_blank"> you host a Podcast called World of Wonder</a> and <a href="http://ribosomemusic.tumblr.com/">you have a blog (Ribosome, Appreciation For Unusual Sounds) where you post short reviews of music from other musicians that interests you. </a>Can you tell us about this? What led you to doing all this work for the music community local and worldwide, and why is it important?</p>
<p>Matt: Let’s start with the live shows:</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, when I first came to this music scene, I was expecting to hear a lot of electronic sound design stuff. While the scene I encountered was very welcoming, <b>I started organizing events to try to create opportunities for musicians that I identified with.</b> <b>Many of these were concept-based performances that emphasized a combination of electronic and acoustic sounds.</b> I also organized events where the musicians would play or sample found objects brought in by the audience, or 40+ musicians would collaborate in a 4 hour drone music piece, or Pmocatat Ensemble &#8211; an ensemble where the artists performed with CDs and tape recordings of their instruments, rather than the instruments themselves.</p>
<p>Rent Romus needed some help in running the Luggage Store series, so he asked me to join in 2003. The San Francisco Electronic Music Festival staff included many people who had worked with me, and they liked that I was good at organizing events. That’s kind o<b>f a tip for musicians who want to get involved with those sorts of arts organizations: Local arts organizations are often on the lookout for people like that: Start putting together a few shows at different venues where it’s not just about getting a gig for your own band, and they’ll probably take notice. </b></p>
<p><b>Anyway, as I grew as an artist and curator over the years, the desire to do these concept-based performances subsided. Rather than try to make musicians play by my rules, I became more interested in hearing what their own rule sets were. </b></p>
<p>Diego: Those ideas are beautiful and inspiring, plus they give a the feeling of a once in a lifetime experience. Anyways they are very attractive and make me want to compile an encyclopedia of improvisational games (or how would you call them?)</p>
<p>Matt: Not sure where you to point you for more information about concept-based performances. I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s a general agreed-upon term.</p>
<p>But &#8220;Game pieces&#8221; are live music improvisational compositions that set up certain sets of rules for musicians interacting with each other. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy5et-D4uyo" target="_blank">The most famous is &#8220;Cobra&#8221; by John Zorn.</a></p>
<p>Diego: That&#8217;s interesting, seems like I have a new topic for research.  Anyways, about curation, what is your approach to it? (Criteria, procedures, etc.)</p>
<p>Matt: At Luggage Store, probably 60% of the booking comes from people contacting us. We’re definitely open to hearing from new people. <b>We’re proud to not be one of those places where you have to be well known or have an audience of x number of people before you can get a gig. We try to keep some open spaces on our calendar for musicians we haven’t heard of to contact us. </b>Other than that, I try to keep an ear to the ground for who is actively playing but hasn’t played our series in a while, or who has just released a CD, and I try to send them invites. Admittedly I’m not terribly good at staying on top of everything, so<b> I hope people will contact us.</b></p>

<p>Matt: I just recently started releasing my own CDs. While trying to compile a list of radio and review contacts, my strategy was to find who I liked who were at about my fame level (which is not very much), and find blogs where their music was being discussed. For some of these musicians, I found their music was being reviewed or independently promoted on one or two blogs. So I decided I’d try to be another avenue where they might be heard of. Blogging is a fairly new world for me. I still have no idea whether I’m doing it right or not, but I’m hesitant to become one of those blogs that reviews every CD that comes my way.</p>
<p>Diego: Why did you start a Podcast?</p>
<p>Matt: As I mentioned earlier, I listen to a lot more CDs than live concerts. I love to hear what an artist does when they have the opportunity to get everything just the way they want it. In the same way that the Luggage Store series supports live musicians, I wanted to create some forum where the completed recordings could be heard. I originally planned to put out only a few podcasts a year, but soon KUSF in Exile asked me to put on a regular show. I did for as long as I could, but since it takes me at least 6 hours to put together a 2 hour program, I couldn’t keep up. I still like doing it though. I’m trying to put out at least one episode per month.<br />
(http://ribosomematt.podomatic.com/)</p>
<p>Diego: Which medium has proven to be more engaging for the audience?</p>
<p>Matt: It’s hard to tell. At the Luggage Store, I can see who comes to each show and talk to them. That’s the most immediately rewarding.</p>
<p>With the podcast, there are about 5 or 6 people in the community who have told me that they follow them. That’s a good thing, because otherwise I probably would’ve given up on it. I was surprised to see that it’s been averaging at about 50 listeners per episode. I often search for experimental music podcasts, so I imagine new similarly-minded people must land on mine every once in a while.</p>
<p>With the blog, that’s still a shot in the dark right now. I have no idea whether people read experimental music blogs or not. If so, who are they? Are they people looking for new music, or artists searching for places where their CD was reviewed?<br />
<b>The blog and the podcast both aim to support the “global-local” community of experimental music. </b>Before the internet, such a community probably only existed between frequently-touring musicians. Now “local” is a level of renown as much as a geographical term. “Local” musicians can easily make their music as available as Kanye West’s.<b> We just need more pointers online that say, “If you like this, then you’ll probably also like this!”</b></p>

<h2><span id="success">[What Makes An Experimental Musician Successful?]</span></h2>
<p>Diego: Through your experience with <a href="/interviews/rent-romus-on-the-san-franciscos-bay-area-experimental-music-scene-and-curating-a-music-series/" target="_blank">the Bay Area’s experimental music scene,</a> either playing, curating, or promoting music in way or another. Which are the qualities that you have observed that have an influence on the success of a musician?</p>
<p>There are certain elements that I think point to a successful musical artist. <strong>By “successful” I mean that I think their records are good, whether or not I personally like them.</strong> Also, the <strong>musicians who have found fame and honest financial success</strong> seem to usually have these qualities:</p>
<ul>
<li>The artist knows what they’re about: They’ve figured out <strong>what they uniquely add</strong> to the large and varied pond that is their art form.</li>
<li>And they’ve figured out <strong>how to communicate and share that</strong>: In practice, they’ve probably focused on distilling their uniqueness rather than trying to catch up with the expectations of their field. They’re probably not the ones who are trying to sound like other artists. In this way, I also think it’s better to specialize in one or a relatively small number of niches than try to be a “jack of all trades”.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the pop artist Beck is a good idea of what I’m trying to get at here. Beck has worked in a number of genres over the years, but in most of his records I feel he’s never stopped sounding like himself. He’s worked hard to be good at what he does, but if he had spent all that time trying to polish himself up to be the most talented or most perfect musician, I don’t think people would’ve detected a musical personality to attach to.</p>
<p>In the experimental world, just about all the most successful or famous musicians I can name are loved for the distinct things they brought to the table.<img class="  aligncenter wp-image-142 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/matt_bw_300.jpg" alt="Matt Davignon's Drum Machine Rig" width="484" height="344" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/matt_bw_300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/matt_bw_300-135x96.jpg 135w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px" /></p>

<h2><span id="recommendations">[Recommendations]</span></h2>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>I could recommend musicians for days. <a href="http://ribosomematt.podomatic.com/" target="_blank">For the best recommendations, I’d suggest listening to my podcast.</a> However, for artists that I strongly identify with:</p>
<p><a href="https://oval.bandcamp.com/album/dok" target="_blank">Oval has been very good at taking sounds apart and reconstructing them into beautiful, flawed new forms.</a> I recommend the album “Dok” as a starting place.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmIQ7ansrA0">Coil made exceptional experimental music </a>(often but not always in a sort of abstract/electronic“post” offshoot from industrial pop music) from the early 80s to the mid 2000s. My favorite record is 1996’s “Black Light District”</p>
<p>I probably wouldn’t sound close to what I do now had I not picked up the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAeVT4tmybs" target="_blank">Jon Hassell/Brian Eno record “4th World Possible Musics”</a> as a teenager. Hassell has created a very unique electronically-inflected personality on his trumpet.</p>
<p>Another big teenage influence was<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nOtaijzlb0" target="_blank"> Klaus Schulze, who was one of those guys who would play 20 minute science fiction epics as a live solo act on synths, organs and tape machines.</a> Very much in the vein of many other artists at the time such as Tangerine Dream. Pick something from the mid 70s and it will probably be a nice listen.</p>
<p>I’ve enjoyed most of what I’ve heard on the <a href="http://www.runegrammofon.com/" target="_blank">Rune Grammofon label out of Norway,</a> including <a href="https://soundcloud.com/rune-grammofon" target="_blank">Alog, Phonophani, Deathprod, Humcrush, Huntsville, Supersilent, and Information.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMtXaRUMFjg" target="_blank">Steve Roden makes music that’s rather similar to mine, though often made from sampling sounds of found objects. </a>His is often a bit quieter, more beautiful, and much more patient. My favorite of his is called “Light Forms”.</p>
<p>Things that have been influential for your art:</p>
<h3>Book(s) / Film(s) / Artist(s)</h3>
<p>It wouldn’t be honest to to say that these have been directly influential to my music. Sometimes something makes me feel quiet, reflective, or awe-struck in a certain way that I’ll want to share, but it feels like it’s the emotion that’s the influence.</p>
<h3>Idea(s)</h3>
<p>There are a few ideas that have been influences. Nature gives me ideas often: bird calls, the sound of things moving in the wind, the sounds of human and animal vocalization and socialization…<br />
Another one was the experience of coming of age musically with limited equipment. My first looping/sampling devices did not record things in perfect 4/4 loops. Once I gained that ability, I still preferred the irregular sounds. So I often build loops now that have similar timing hiccups.</p>
