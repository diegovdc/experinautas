<h2 id="improvising-with-a-laptop">Improvising with a laptop computer</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: What do you think that makes laptop based improvisation different from improvisation with acoustic or electric instruments or even synthesizers?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron: I think the big difference with laptop improvisation is that with a computer system you can create any sound, it is the least limited sound palette. You can create any sound by pushing a button as long as you have it available to you. Obviously with an acoustic instrument you are limited to what the instrument can do, there are extended techniques, which extends the sound palette but is a fairly limited thing. A violin sounds like a violin, unless if you tap it you get different sounds but on the whole it sounds like a violin. There are regular synthesizers which also much more limited in the sounds they can create, there is a very wide variety, among modular synthesizers, but unless you are using sampled sounds it is fairly limited. It is more like a regular instrument and you tend to have more automatically at your fingers that you can do right away. </span><b>Whereas laptop can do anything basically but that is a problem I found, the lack of limitations makes it difficult to find a starting point.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The fact that you can do anything can make it hard to decide what to do, if you have an unlimited number of options in front of you you have to pare those down otherwise you will never be able to make a decision. Most laptop improvisers make and program their own instrument.So laptop improvisation implies that, starting from an unlimited palette, you have to figure out what kind of thing you want to do. If you make your own program you sort of start from scratch and you can build up there.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-337 alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Aaron1.jpg" alt="Aaron1" width="400" height="400" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Aaron1.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Aaron1-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Aaron1-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Aaron1-96x96.jpg 96w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" />So how I started doing it was, when I was at Mills [College] taking improvisation classes, I would come in with an idea of what I wanted to sound like and what I wanted to be able to do, and then tried to play with people. At the beginning, I would want to do something and not be able to, for example if I wanted to be able to make a really quick percussive sound. So I would go home that night and add that capability to my instrument. I kept modifying the instrument until I got to a point where I did not feel like I kept having to add things to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: What kind of limits did you settle with?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron: I have always been interested in having the computer sound like a computer, it can sound like anything. I could be playing violin samples or something or I could be playing synthesizer sounds or anything I wanted to</span><b>. But there are some sounds that you cannot get except from a digital system, those sort of glitchy, clicking kind of error sounds. That was a really important part of my aesthetic from the beginning, I was interested in exploring the sounds that only a computer could make. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a lot of clicks and glitches and sounds that usually you are trying to avoid because you do not want something to sound like a computer, but I do want it to sound like a computer because otherwise what is the point of using a computer? I embrace that. The instrument I made mostly uses samples through granular synthesis, which is a technique that takes a sound and kind of chops it up into tiny little pieces and reassembles after that. Granulation is usually used to stretch out sound or layer things or slow things down without changing the pitch and a lot of things like that. The goal a lot of the time is to have this smooth sound where it is slowed down, the pitch is not changed and it just feels like it is stretched and extended. With traditional granulation you are not supposed to be able to hear the tiny little slices individually.  But essentially what I made was a very bad granulator where you can hear the tiny little slices, it is not as smooth sounding, and it is there where the artifacts come out, the clicking and error sounds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Diego: How do you produce that effect, the clicking and the artifacts, is it the length of the sample?</em> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron: A regular granular synthesis sample is 30 – 100 milliseconds long, so very short. With mine the samples are a little longer so you can hear the individual ones. Also with traditional granular synthesis you want to have an envelope on the sounds so you have a 30 second sample but it fades in and fades out smoothly each one of them, whereas mine has harsh cuts, I think that is kind of the main thing mine ends up doing or how I get the artifacts. The glitchiness is the harsh cuts that come out of it, even if I have very short samples I can hear the beginning and the end of them very clearly as opposed to the smooth sort of in and out fading kind of effect</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: How do you keep real time control on the sound?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron: That was one of the pretty difficult things that took a long time. I do not use any MIDI controllers or anything. Early at Mills I made that decision inspired by Ikue Mori’s setup. She visited in my first or second week at Mills, and talked about her stuff. She does not use controllers because it is just simpler and more portable. If you are carrying around a MIDI keyboard every time you play a gig, it is another thing to take with you, it is another thing to break, you can lose it or you just forget to bring it or something like that. What do you do? You cannot play. So many people who do live computer music their systems crash, computers crash, something is not working right, things like that. The more peripherals you add the more likely you will have a technical issue. So I just decided to not have any peripherals and just use the laptop. My controls are all the computer keyboard. </span></p>
<p>Real time control was really just a matter of sort of trial and error. Hitting a key will make a sound for the most part or it will turn on some process or something like that. I had to make it so that at least there were some things that did not require any setup, I just hit a key and something happens immediately.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The things that ended up being a bigger problem was having to stop a sound really quickly. The ability to change really quickly is something that is really important to free improvisation. The most effective moments to me are when you have four people playing together and they are all free improvising but when you can get that moment where everything changes in a second without planning it, without someone giving a downbeat, without anything, just by listening and intuition, that is such a beautiful thing when it happens. Early on I would have these processes running and sound coming out of my system, something would happen and I would want to change it really quickly but I could not so I would hit stop and it would trail off and still have another five seconds of sound. I realized that was a big problem so I had to get rid of that and make sure I can hit a key and change things, kill it or whatever right away. It was really just making sure it was responsive to quickly making sounds and stopping making sound which sounds like a basic idea but it was not obvious to begin with</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Diego: Yeah it took a while to figure out what was happening. I imagine that the learning curve for participating in improvisation was a little bit steeper for you because you had to go back to programming.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron: Yeah exactly. It took a while; the other thing about laptop improvisation is that you are building your instrument at the same time as you are learning to play it. When I was starting out I would add some functionality but then I would have to learn to play that in a musical way. Not only was my system not very well thought out, well programmed or finished, I also was not good at playing it at the beginning. It took a while to develop some ability and remember how to do things and have everything available without having to think about it, that was another thing. </span><b>It was important to make it easy to start to make a sound so that I would not have to think about it, if you have to think about it before making sound then you lose the intuition, really quick responses and the kind of dialogue you can have when you have this immediate ability to do something</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was also a matter of just practice and playing and learning the instrument that I made and its capabilities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: Did it happen to you that made your program more complex than it was necessary?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron: Yeah there are definitely things that I added and then I took away but I do not remember what. On the whole, I think I tried to not do that too much and just sort of added stuff when I felt like I needed it. A lot of the time if there was a sound I wanted to make, I would try to do it without programming anything. If I wanted a specific sound, I did not have anything in my patch built in that could play a C on demand just because that is not what I was interested in, but sometimes you want to be able to do that. I could have made another element of it that would have allowed me to play pitched materials really quickly and whatever but I was more interested in trying to figure that out how to do that with the tools I already had. </span><b>When it started to feel like a real instrument was when I started to figure out how to use what I had already made to make totally different things that I had not planned on</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: Are there aspects of the music that you leave to the computer?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron: There is a lot of randomness. Some people are really into the artificial intelligence kind of thing where the computer has a lot of decisions; there are decisions trees, Markov chains and things like that. I just had certain elements randomized but in a range that I will set.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With things like the granulators, the size of each slice of sound is randomized but I can make it short, medium or long. I will say long and it will be 1 – 2 seconds or so, if it is short it will be less than one hundred milliseconds, medium is somewhere in between. I can make it dense, medium or sparse; those are basically the controls over the granulator and the pitch. There are random elements to everything but I always instantiate the sound, I start the sound at least, it is mostly under my control. Randomness is more to insert variety into the sound rather than just to let it do whatever it wants to. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people creates these system where the computer is more an improviser they are playing with and mine I do not feel is like that, I do not feel I am improvising with my computer as another agent. For me my computer is the instrument and I am playing it. People like George Lewis with his Voyager System, which is an old artificial intelligence type system, was something that could be played by a person but would still be totally autonomous and listen to the performers as they play. He played trombone and he had a thing that would listen to him playing trombone and improvise and he did not have to do anything, he just started the program, it would run. I have never been interested in that sort of thing I think because I think that is appealing to people who play an instrument, who can improvise on another instrument and want to be able to play a solo show but not have it just be their instruments. Since I do not play another instrument to any degree of competency, I do not need to play something and have my computer respond to me, I’d rather just play the computer.</span></p>

<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: For you, what is the difference between a solo set and a collective improvisation?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron: I use the exact same software, the same Max patch for both. What ended up happening was once I had a really satisfying improvisation system which allowed me to make the sounds I wanted in response to other people,  I realized that is was also a very good system on a whole so I started making solo pieces with that system, but that was not the original intent. It was started as something I could use to play with other people but once I developed it, it was powerful enough so that I could play by myself and create enough sound and variation. It is the exact same thing, I just play more. If I am playing with other people I will just play a little less, I will be listening to them and responding or ignoring them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But my solo stuff is usually slower and focused on a single development rather than a whole lot of things, changes and all that stuff that you get with free improvisation. It was really just a happy accident that it ended up being just a good multipurpose instrument that I ended it with, because that is not what I was trying to do.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: How did your practice session look like?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron: Definitely the most useful thing is always playing with other people because that makes me work on my reflexes and stuff and make sure everything is easily available to me. I do not practice specifically but I will just sit down and play. I do not play scales or anything but I will just try something out, start with a sound, see what I can do with it, play with a single idea for a long time or things like that. I always just record everything I do, absolutely everything. I have way too many recordings of stuff because my patch just has a button that says record so every time I want to play around with stuff I will just hit it.<img class="wp-image-340 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Aaron4.jpg" alt="Aaron4" width="546" height="528" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Aaron4.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Aaron4-300x290.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Aaron4-99x96.jpg 99w" sizes="(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="sample-based-music"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advantages of sample based music</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: It seems to me that you are more interested in using sound objects or found sounds to work with, synthesize with or generate sounds purely by the computer</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron: Yeah partly that is just a matter of convenience especially in improvisation. One of the things I have never really liked to much about modular synthesizer improvisation is that it takes them a long time, generally they will patch something with patch cables and have something setup. Whatever they setup is usually not very malleable, it is difficult to quickly change to another sound, which is, again, a very effective thing you can do in group improvisation. </span></p>
<p><b>Partly it was just that if everything is rooted in samples I can just change the sample to something completely different and the sound will change completely even if it is the exact same process that is setup</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is playing back at the same pitch, same effects, everything else is exactly the same, if you change from an accordion sample to street sounds it is going to sound completely different even without changing any other element. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally I actually wanted to do more synthesis because I like synthesis and also when I was thinking about the aesthetics of electronic music I was like, “what is the point of using samples because it will just sound like something else. It can sound like another instrument but I could always just get someone else to play that instrument. Why should my computer sound like a piano, it should sound like a computer so I will do synthesis, it is electronic not an acoustic instrument”. In doing that I found my sound very limited and it was hard to shift very quickly. Just changing the bottom of the chain into samples allowed me to switch really fast into something else. Then by just applying a lot of processes and the granulation it still sounds very electronic, you would not confuse my stuff for an actual piano even if I am playing a piano sample because I will do a lot of things to it and it does not sound anything like the original but just the fact that I can change it quickly allows for that sort of quick juxtaposition and things like that</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: Is the whole of your performance system built upon the idea of playing samples?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron: Yeah basically. It is sort of modular so there are a bunch of different modules,  but the root modules are the granulators that I made. There are three of those so I can have three different samples being granulated at the same time or three of the same sample and different effects or different things. Beyond that there are effects that I have; things can be routed into one another. The granulators can also record internal process so I can route from one granulator into another one and then manipulate the sound that is coming out already</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: Like chaining the granulators?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron: Yeah chain them together because let us say one of them is playing stuff back at double speed so it is up an octave and then the next one is taking that sound and then playing it back up another octave. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I did a piece a little while ago a few times and it is on my SoundCloud where I took speech samples and then slowed them down a lot, to like 10% speed, and then using another of the granulators I sped it back up to full speed. It was this weird effect, it sounded sort of synthesized but sort of still voice like but indecipherable because it was moving through the sound very slowly but at the right pitch. That was a nice effect</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: You also have some pieces where you work with actual prerecorded music, am I right?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron: Yeah. I never put a lot of thought into the samples that I use in my music. When I was starting out I just kind of took stuff that was on my hard drive and threw it into the folder where my patch picks up samples. That was stuff I recorded myself in the studio, this accordion sound that I use a lot and some other regular instruments. But a lot of it was just music I had on my hard drive and I just tossed it in there. Sometimes it is just a song that I like and there is a moment that sounds really cool if I sample that and it is not very recognizable because it is just a fraction of a second or a single guitar note or something. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel like it is sort of Plunderphonic in a way so a lot of the time I will build a piece around a tiny fraction of an existing song. Knowing the source for me gives me a feeling of some emotional attachment to the sound and affects the way I am going to make a piece around that just because I know where it came from. A lot of the time what I am trying to do is capture a feeling of that moment that I really like in that song and make that ten minutes long or something, sort of extend that feeling out</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: The possibility of focusing on something that is really small but feels full of content, I think that is really attractive. It also seems like this kind of music even if it is very abstractly treated and processed, will still retain several of the qualities of the original. I think that people  who listen to it, even if they are not into abstract or experiential music, will find something that would help them relate to it.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron: Hopefully, that is always the hope that you can appeal to someone who is not as much into that kind of thing. I am usually interested a lot in the timbral quality of an instrument or a sound so it is both the emotional attachment I have with the song when I am doing that sort of thing but usually there is a nice sound that I like that I really want to explore. Because it is such a small fraction it gets stretched out, I think it avoids being overly referential. No one is going to hear that and be like it is that song and not have to listen to the rest of it or something, it is not just about the reference at all.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-339 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Aaron3.jpg" alt="Improvising with other musicians using a laptop computer" width="4032" height="3024" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Aaron3.jpg 4032w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Aaron3-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Aaron3-768x576.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Aaron3-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Aaron3-128x96.jpg 128w" sizes="(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px" /></p>
<h2 id="interacting"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interacting with other musicians</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: When you are interacting with other musicians do you have samples or do you do live sampling?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron: I do some times. I do not know, I am always back and forth on whether or not I like doing live sampling but I do do it. Sometimes I do not like the way other people do that, I feel like it can be a kind of easy cheap effect and sometimes musicians do not like it if you sample them while they are playing, if they can tell you are doing that it will confuse them. It has happened to me several times where I have sampled someone and shifted them or something and if they can tell they are being sampled it will snap them out of what they are doing a lot of the time. If I am sampling live I will want to manipulate it so that it creates this responsive sound and it is not clear that it is from them directly because if it is just sort of echoing them, following along or whatever it often really confuses them. Also my feeling is if I am just sampling them and affecting them I am just an effect pedal. What is the point of me being there? I can just give them this thing and they can play through and it sounds cool. It is relying a little too much on what other musicians are going to do. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, one of the things I do avoiding other equipment, I just use the internal microphone on the laptop which sounds terrible anyway, it just picks up everything, you can get a lot of feedback and other things. It is not like I am doing a perfect sampling of someone else and manipulating in some fancy way, I am just kind of taking their sound and doing something with it but also there are other stuff going on, the crappy microphone is its own process, distortion and filtering, just by being really bad.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: What do you think is the optimal way for interacting with other musicians?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron: One of the problems with computer musicians is that they feel like their computer is doing everything and the human is superfluous, they are just pressing to play or whatever. What I am going for is a clear sense that there is a human making the sound, I am playing this, I am listening to them and responding to them and they can feel that response and that dialogue. Just having the same abilities as an acoustic instrument in terms of being able to play with other people is what I am going for, that versatility and responsiveness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="max-msp-patch"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron’s Patch</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: We have talked a little bit about your patch but I would like to know which other processes do you use besides the three granulators?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron: I have a drum machine which just plays back drum samples if I hit a key but also I can make a pattern and have that loop. There a few delays I can use. Then some distortion and equalizations and things like that but it is mostly the granulators. However everything kind of plugs into one another. Sometimes I will take the drum sound and plug that into a granulator in real time so that when I hit it a drum beat, you will hear a chopped up version of that same drum beat, things like that. There is really not that much effects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The delay I use a lot,  both as a reverb and as an echo delay. They come from a patch that I made a long time ago which creates twenty delay loops of randomized times within a certain range. I will have twenty delays between one hundred and two hundred milliseconds then you will get those massive sounds, you can also manipulate that in real time and change the length of the delays. It is also kind of another instrument. The source is usually kind of the bottom of the whole system, the granulators</span></p>

<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: What do you recommend to someone who is starting on Max/MSP?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron: It is really hard to get into with nothing. I feel like what I would say is I found it a lot easier to get into once I really understood basic synthesis ideas. Playing with a modular synthesizer is actually really helpful for Max and trying to understand what is going on, you have your oscillators, generators, you can plug things in together and things like that. Max is built on that idea but it is hard to see what is really happening if you do not understand the ideas behind it and it is a lot easier to tell what is going on when you have these physical things in front of you that you are playing with. You can turn a dial and hear the pitch go up and down, plug that into another oscillator and you are modulating the frequency of that one with the first one, you can turn the dial and here the way the timber changes. That is all stuff you can do in Max, but you kind of have to know how to do it first before you can do it, how to set up that system, you cannot just plug something into something else because that does not always do anything.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="sf-experimental-electronic-music-scene"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The San Francisco Bay Area’s experimental electronic music scene</span></h2>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: How would you describe the experimental electronic music scene here and what trends do you identify?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron: There are two major streams in the experimental electronic scene music here. There´s the noise music which tends to be younger punk kind of kids and people who have been doing it for a long time, and then there is the Mills people who do a similar thing because we all studied with the same people and they do that kind of thing, John </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bischoff</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Chris Brown who are two of the professors. There are a lot of people who do laptop stuff and then there are people who make their own gear which is another thing that happened at Mills, people who learn how to make their own synthesizers, physical effects or circuitry stuff. Then there are the people who just buy a bunch of pedals, plug them in and make noise with them. The experimental electronic music, outside of the noise scene it is not a very big area here which is kind of surprising; it is not as big as the instrumental improvisers which is what I see the most in here. There are a lot of people who use the computers as effects primarily for their other instruments they are using, that is probably a more common thing than people who are just playing laptop and there are a lot of people who are just doing modular synths, effects boxes and things like that.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="electronic-music-and-science"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electronic music and science</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: I was intrigued by one of your tracks, the one in which you are on an airplane and are playing with sine waves, and the lady asked you is this music or science.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron: That is an old one.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: And then you said “a little bit of both”.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron: That was a funny piece. Then was when I took Pauline Oliveros’ class at Mills. The assignment was to make a piece in an unusual place. The early assignments were to make a piece with an unusual melody or an unusual something or other. This was to perform a piece in an unusual place. That weekend I was flying to Vancouver so I decided to try something on the airplane. But I just had my laptop with me and ended up doing this sort of Alvin Lucier type thing where just played sound waves out of my computer speakers which were roughly tuned but slightly out of tune with the engine which was 300 hertz or something. I faded them in and out. That piece I really liked, and that was just a nice moment. I stuck my Zoom on top of my computer so that I picked up a good amount of the speaker noise because the speakers on these things are not very loud and the plane was really loud. I could hear it but it was mostly that you could hear this beating against the engine noise, you could not really hear the sine tones, it was like something kind of happened but it was not really obvious that anything happened if you were not paying attention to it which was really cool. I think that kind of comes across in the recording where it is really subtle. That piece turned out really well, there were people talking in German about 30-Rock behind me and stuff like that. Right at the end the woman next to me asked me what I was doing because she could see that I had a max patch open and it was this weird thing and she was wondering what it was.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: Do you think there is a relationship between the kind of music you do with science?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron: Yeah I think so to some degree. I have internalized a lot of ideas from psychoacoustics and the way we perceive sound through Alvin Lucier who I think was a huge influence on everyone. Knowing how to get these psychoacoustic effects is kind of related to science, knowing how sound waves work, how synthesis works and internalizing those ideas I think does make it a little bit related to science. I am not just playing something and being like “oh I like that”. I can imagine a sound and then figure out how to create it purely through computer systems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is definitely related to science. That was always a criticism that people made of Alvin Lucier that it was not really music it was just science experiments or something which I thought was really stupid. But it is true that in his stuff especially, there is this element that is so minimal and he has such clear process based music. He has a very musical sense and he knows what he is doing, he came to Mills one year, I spent quite a bit of time with him and he thinks musically he does not think in terms of science, he does these literally experimental pieces and process pieces because he thinks it will have a musical effect not because he thinks it will be cool. He thinks it will sound nice, interesting. There is still that element of science and you have to understand how sound works to be able to do that sort of thing.</span></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakob Pek is a virtuoso and extremely creative free improviser with the spirit of a poet, and a keen sense for sound, space and silence. Jakob is mainly active with the Bay Area&#8217;s creative music scene, playing solo or with other musicians such as Nava Dunkelman (in DunkelPek), and with </span><a href="/interviews/andrew-jamieson-music-race-religion/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Jamieson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Joshua Marshall (in El 3).  During this interview he spoke with a beautifully eloquent and thoughtful slowness (often also humorously) about the importance of improvisation for human life: how it fosters being in the moment, awareness and human community. Another part of the interview was dedicated to reflect on what it takes to become an improviser, how is improvisation tied to practice, and the manner in which he has been practicing as of late.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(As a multifaceted artists, Jakob is also a poet and a painter. All paintings shown interview are has, and as of February 2016, they are being exhibited at </span><a href="/interviews/fernando-carpenter-vinyl-records-curating-experimental-music-shows/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VAMP: Art &amp; Music</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>

<h2 id="the-purpose-of-music">The Purpose Of Music</h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego Villaseñor: I don&#8217;t know if you remember but when we first met you asked me what was the purpose of music. I perceive that you have a very philosophical and spiritual way of being and doing music so I would like to ask you the same question.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakob Pek:  I would say it is multifaceted. At a very essential level it has to do with fostering human community and just being together with our fellow humans. I think that is a very essential aspect of it. And I think another aspect of it is to deepen and expand our capacities for pattern recognition. That is another potential purpose it can serve. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: How do you realize this two purposes through your work? How do you develop them? How do you focus on them when you are doing your work?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakob: If some musical expression seems to not make any sense, I would try to listen closer until it makes some kind of sense . If it makes some kind of sense then I&#8217;m assuming some sort of pattern or intelligence that has been recognized. If you happen to be doing this with 30 people in a room, all together listening to something that seems like a lot of nonsense but it is not nonsense, it is just a lot of information to deal with, that can create a communal experience of&#8230; hanging with your brothers and sisters [laughs].</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: So for you for example, maybe when you improvise, you start with some kind of random pattern which you can&#8217;t grasp in it&#8217;s entirety, and then try to explore it on the site?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakob: I guess so. You know it&#8217;s funny because leading back to the purpose thing, the whole pattern things seem kind of cerebral and soulless.  </span><b>Another purpose of music is to make experienceable aspects both of human life and those that lie beyond human life. It’s as if  music can be a very potent dose of the species’ history or the planet’s history. It is a way of making knowable aspects of reality that can’t be known in any other way.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So as I am beginning to improvise, I am not really thinking let me make a pattern or some shit like that, I am just trying to tune into my organism and, well, I suppose I conceive of music as an autonomous thing that exist even if I don&#8217;t, so I am considering myself as trying to engage with some sort of something of the other, this music of the other, and to see what it wants to do. I am more interested in what music wants me to do then what I want to do. Sometimes they are the same thing and that is really great when what I want and what the music want are the same thing, but sometimes what the music wants I don’t want and then I have to say, well, forget what I want.</span></p>
<h2 id="the-experience-of-improvisation"><img class="wp-image-302 size-full aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Jakob-Pek-Painting-1.jpg" alt="A Painting By Jakob Pek" width="600" height="598" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Jakob-Pek-Painting-1.jpg 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Jakob-Pek-Painting-1-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Jakob-Pek-Painting-1-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Jakob-Pek-Painting-1-96x96.jpg 96w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></h2>
<h2>The Experience Of Improvisation</h2>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego:  There is some kind of relationship between you and your body and this other thing and the music that emerges in an improvisation is like this interaction between those two things. Is that what you mean?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakob:  Yes, I mean. What is happening when you improvise? </span><b>You are tuning into the whole lineage of the species and then you&#8217;re doing something that is so old that it has been around from before-before-before; you are doing pre-historic things when you improvise. It is &#8220;primitive&#8221;, it is the oldest way to make music, and every time you do it, it is something completely new. It is a living paradox because it is always the newest thing. Every time you improvise you are making the newest music that has ever existed. It is also the oldest musical way ever.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> So you are tapping into a very expansive time stream and that&#8217;s cool and challenging and sort of ridiculous. I think maybe part of the reason why free improvisation is not readily accepted by a lot of people, or easily accepted, or even done by a lot of musicians is because it is challenging&#8230; to open yourself up to that time stream and deal with what comes out, because it is not necessarily pleasant or beautiful, I mean it&#8217;s hard stuff a lot of time.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego:  And somehow people would talk about free improvisation as something that has a history of 60 years or so.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakob: Which is not true, that the free improv thing has only been around since Coltrane decided to do that or whoever decided to do what. It is not true&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know, another important thing is that the word improvisation arose from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">improvisus</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Latin word for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">unforeseen</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There is also this essential aspect of improvisation that is mysterious. You don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to happen. You have to be willfully unknowing about how things are going to unfold, and to fully engage with that chaos and mystery is essential to actually creating improvised music that is of potency or importance. I would say.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego:</span><b> What do you search for when you&#8217;re listening and when you are playing?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Which aspects of sound, of the whole sound that&#8217;s being generated attract you the most and lead your exploration, or engage you the most?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakob:</span><b> This is one of my secrets. The secret is I am always trying to listen to the contextual silence of what is happening.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> So I&#8217;m not necessarily engaging directly with any of the content or any of the material, but I&#8217;m always trying to allow my attention to dissolve into silence. As in the bed of nothingness in which the music is happening. And from that place I feel like I can be everywhere in the music because, you know, the empty space is everywhere. So I&#8217;m trying to listen as that, I am just trying to be that and trust my autonomous responses from that space. When I&#8217;m listening to an improvisation, I am allowing my attention to dissolve into nothingness. I am trying to be empty silence and let the music happen and whatever happens through my organism I just let that happen.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: Don&#8217;t you think that there might be certain recurring things about how you engage with that?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakob: Yes and I don&#8217;t think it is the only way to engage but it is what I have sort of gone through to sort of put the emphasis on receptivity and openness as opposed engaging or directive attention. Instead of this directive attention, more of this dissolving attention into emptiness. Instead of a tight focus. Just giving the gift of listening to everyone who is playing or not playing. Let me receive what they are doing. Let me really receive whatever sound they are making so I can&#8217;t really respond to them in an intelligent, honest, and heartfelt way.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: Would you say that that characterizes your style of playing?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakob: Yes. It is a deep openness to the present moment and creating from what the present moment is calling for. And that makes for a hard sell getting gigs. It is like &#8220;what do you play?&#8221; It is not a musical thing or a musical context but a quality of consciousness that characterizes my approach to improvising.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: And how do you feel about connecting with the audience?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakob: I think it can connect in a really deep way because in a weird way I am listening like they are and curious about what is going on. I feel like it helps me to be really receptive to the space.  I am also receiving, I am feeling the vibes of the listeners and that is undoubtedly informing what I&#8217;m doing. I am trying to be with them as much as possible, be with my fellow players  as much as possible, be with the space as much as possible. So it is very informing. All who are present are taking part in what is being created.</span></p>

<h2>What Makes For A Good Improvisation?</h2>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: How would you define a good improvisation?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakob: It is a lovely thing when the improvisation feels complete and whole and comes full circle in a way. It is a deeply satisfying feeling. But I don&#8217;t think that an improvisation necessarily has to be satisfying or wholesome to be successful. I guess at the end of the day, I just want it to be honest and truthful. So if I can portray something truthful then it is successful.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: And an excellent improvisation?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakob: An excellent improv is not truthful but The Truth. [laughs]</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: In that sense, who would you say is the prophet of improvisation?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakob:  When I&#8217;ve seen Roscoe Mitchell live it is very profound. It becomes so much truth that it’s just overwhelming&#8230; visceral&#8230;total. It&#8217;s something very deep going on. I have been deeply moved by my teachers and seeing them perform&#8230; there are many prophets of improvisation. Roscoe Mitchell and Fred Frith, those are two of many.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: Do you think that improvisation can transcend the live circumstances in which it was created?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakob: So, like I recorded piece of music? I mean, yeah, it can.  The thing is to experience it live is a very different thing. I mean, it is not like you can&#8217;t learn or have a beautiful listening experience through a recorded improvisation but to be there live, there is something very vital about that. It is just important to notice that certain people who won&#8217;t engage with a recording of improvised will engage with it live, because it is right there, there is the visual and somatic  and the here and now of the emotion, everything is there in the live setting. I do think it transcends the live context but at the end of the day, that is where it is at for me, just live, sharing the music live with others. It is the deepest way to experience this music.</span></p>

<h2>Practicing Improvisation And Preparing For a Solo Gig</h2>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: So how do you prepare for a solo gig?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakob: I would not say I prepare for an improvised gig, what I do is try to keep an emptiness around the evening that is coming. If there are ideas about what could happen, I almost try to abandon them and not attach myself to them. I have no idea what the space would want.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s just the willingness to be vulnerable and open. It is also such a joy to have complete freedom. There is a freedom when all I have to engage with is the space and the listeners and myself. There is a freedom in that that is very lovely and also a profound challenge and responsibility for the music at the same time, that you aren&#8217;t going to find while playing in groups or even a duo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why do I like to play alone&#8230;? Because there is a core aspect of freedom to it. I like the challenge and responsibility. It is on me, I have to meet that, so it is a lot of fun. It becomes a way to be with the moment. It is a lovely way to be with the moment and to share that with people and to share being spiritually naked in music with whoever dares to be with you or is willing or happy to be with you in that space. As far as preparation I think it is willingness to be deeply vulnerable,</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego:  When did you decide you had the abilities to do that?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakob:  Well I have been doing this since I&#8217;ve been 15 or 16. I&#8217;d go to those open mics and started to play solo improvisations. When I was younger there were a lot of solo guitarists that had a big effect on my playing, acoustic fingerpickers and jazz guitarists such as Ted Greene and Lenny Breau. So it has been there from the beginning as far as my loving to play the guitar by myself. As the years went by the music just got a big odder and outer&#8230;</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: How do you practice your instruments? How do you practice your techniques?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakob: As far as practice is concerned, I think it is about creating ways through which the creative spirit can have autonomy over the organism. It is like learning some sort of chordal pattern to the point of unforgettability and then in the moment of improv there isn&#8217;t even a trying to do, it just happens. So with practicing, I am just trying to condition my organism to the point that I have these tools that can be utilized effortlessly without any sort of conscious engagement, because all the conscious engagement that is happening from practice when, I&#8217;m really taking the my time to integrate whatever I am doing, so that when I am playing, there is none of that overt cognizance. It is just a surrender to the creation and to the flow in that moment. So preparing instrumentally and practicing techniques and patterns with my hands and with sound very carefully and quietly and precisely and effortlessly, you know,  just tip toeing, gently through whatever I am working on, to really settle it into my body. Then when it is time to create it is just there. It is something that can be used if the creative spirit so wishes to use it. So I am just trying to give the creative spirit more things to use.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: So you completely separate practice from creation?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakob: Not necessarily, but</span><b> if I am practicing there is more cerebralness going on, there&#8217;s conceptions around what I am doing, and A to B to C, and a diligence of paying very close attention to the intricacies of what I am working on, so that I know I am really setting it into my organism so when it is time to play, it is just there.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There is no trying to do it. It is like Charlie Parker said(and  he was a Virgo like me) and he said you practice music, practice it until it is perfect, and then when you play you forget about it. I agree, that you practice it until it is so embedded into you, whether it is a tune or a scale or whatever you are working on, you practice it quietly, carefully, and gently and perfectly until it is so embedded in you that if the creative spirit wants to use it, it is right there. There is no strain at all. It just flows right out of you and you&#8217;re like &#8220;oh wow that was cool!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: And how do you structure your time with music, do you practice and then improvise or&#8230;</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakob:  It just depends on what I am working on at the time. Sometimes I essentially have a stack of things I am working on so I just go through the stack and that&#8217;s it, just go through the same stack for months and then ok, that&#8217;s been practiced enough, so what next.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: How do you decide the elements in that stack?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakob: It just depends if I want to learn a song so I would pick that song, write arrangements of it, and improvise through the harmonies.  How do I know that I really don&#8217;t know? I just wrote a little tune and I&#8217;m just playing to the tune like a million times. I&#8217;m trying to play it all these different ways and play the chords in all these different ways and I know someday when I have a performance, it will all just be there. All the little things I did will just be there to play with.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: An about improvisation, do you do that before you practice or after you practice?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakob: I don&#8217;t know. My way of life is not very organized or scheduled, which I think is part of it. I was thinking that if you really want to play freely improvised music, you can&#8217;t really know much of how things are going to go in your day. You have to live in a way, like you don&#8217;t know where you&#8217;re going to be in a hour. It&#8217;s is crazy in some sense to live in a world where you are engaged with life and moments in such a way that, the planning almost seems absurd, but that helps inform what I&#8217;m doing. I used to be very organized spending a half hour here and another one there, and I wanted everything to be scheduled and everything in some sort for preordained time slot, but then it became so superficial and it was not honest. My way of life is very, not chaotic, but a little bit. Chaotic enough that I can play with chaos and not get overwhelmed. It is not ordered in any sort of obvious way which I believe helps me with improvising, and so maybe it helps me improvise</span>.</span></p>

<h2 id="the-importance-of-free-improvisation">The Importance Of Free Improvisation</h2>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego:  It is an interesting point. The importance of the coherence between &#8220;form and content&#8221;.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakob: </span><b>However you live your life is going to inform your music. It is going to make your music. It could be that there are a lot of people that want to make a certain type of music but because of the way they live they will never make that kind of music. They should be trying to make the music that their life is or live the life that is the music that they want to make.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sometimes I wonder how possible that is. People live in this divide. For some reason a lot of musicians don&#8217;t want to make </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">their</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> music. They want to make something else, like they want to make jazz, or they are trying to represent something that has already been done, or to simply be accepted. What I see is a lot of musicians don&#8217;t make the music that is their life.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: Would you say this is one of the essential things that an improviser must know?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakob: Yes, I would think it is important and inevitable because if you were to improvise you would have to do that. It is just the way it is.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: It is much more powerful when your life is in tune with whatever you are doing.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakob: </span><b>Yes. It is the capacity to listen and to receive the vibrations that is so important because it creates coherence and understanding around what is happening. If you want to say anything musically with meaning and truth you have got to be listening deeply so that you know what you are responding to, whether you are giving a question or offering an answer. You just make the music of your life and listen, receive the vibrations as deeply, and then the music knows what to do because the organism is receiving information, but if you are not receiving openly, you can respond in any sort of real way?</b></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: This is not only for music but also for&#8230;</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakob: &#8230;every fucking thing in life!</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: That&#8217;s why I feel that improvisation is necessary, at least for me, as a spiritual practice, to be constantly in touch with whatever is given in the moment, and being creative with the ways I have to respond to it.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakob: For real.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego:  What would you say characterizes the music scene in the Bay Area?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakob: </span><b>What I see in the experimental music scene in the Bay is a very strong intention on changing the injustices and idiocies of our current world.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There is a will to change the absurdities and the criminality of the way things are in this world right now</span><b>. I also see a very strong will towards fostering a human connection across wide divides.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It is a beautiful thing to make music with people much older that you or to play with someone who might not seem to have obvious connections with you, but because there is this openness to improvise music here, a cross-cultural dialogue can happen in a very profound and beautiful way that allows for human community to form across wide divides.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is there, but it&#8217;s also&#8230; it is not nearly there as much as one would wish, but it is trying to get there in a very real way and seeing it in the scene just reveals how absent it is in the common culture, like this honest communication with your fellows and when you&#8217;re seeing it to to  happen in the music scene, you can see its importance and how lacking it is in the daily affairs of the status quo. So yeah, a push to transform the status quo and a push to create togetherness among humans. I see that. I have seen lots of beautiful things ,and with the beauty  tragic things, so&#8230;</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego:  What do you think is the most relevant feature about making this kind of music?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakob:  That it requires that you engage fully with the present moment. It calls for that, that you have to give the whole of yourself to the present moment. And why is that relevant? Because then you can get into timelessness, </span><b>by something demanding or requiring that you to engage with the present moment you can glimpse realities that are timeless, and having a glimpse of things that are timeless teaches you how to live in the world of time.</b></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: Do you think that it is important for humanity?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakob: Yes. Yes I do.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego:   I agree&#8230; That was the last question.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakob:  Groovy.</span></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this interview with composer, author, filmmaker and educator Jack Curtis Dubowsky we talk about live music for film. Everything from what is needed to organize a show involving film and music, to the different techniques (improvisatory, structural etc.) he uses and how he prepares his ensemble for live performance.</p>
<p>For his live music for film, Jack performs with the Jack Curtis Dubowsky Ensemble, combining acoustic instruments, electronic hardware, composed material, and structured improvisation. He is also a composer of orchestral and choral music, and has written on the various intersections of cinema, animation, music, and sexuality. In March 2016 Palgrave MacMillan will be publishing my first monograph, entitled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Intersecting-Queerness-Palgrave-Studies-Audio-Visual/dp/1137454202" target="_blank">Intersecting Film, Music, and Queerness.</a></p>
<h2 id="introduction-live-music-film">An introduction to live music for film</h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: How did you get into doing live music for film?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jack: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started scoring indie films professionally in 2001. I had been working in Pixar’s in-house music department since about 1997, back when the company was in Point Richmond, even before the Emeryville campus. From a practical standpoint, film and media are areas where a composer or musician can get some monetary compensation and work with other interesting, creative people.  Many composers entertain fantasies of meeting some Diaghilev figure and composing ballets and operas.  I was particularly interested in opera.  But, there are just more opportunities for work in film.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started JCDE in 2008.  I wanted my own group to do live performances under my own name, rather than some obfuscating ensemble name.  Doing live music for film was a way to bring in my expertise from the professional world, but furthermore it was a way to bring in filmmakers and a wider audience. We started doing performances incorporating film in 2009 at ATA (Artists Television Access) on Valencia Street in San Francisco. We did films by Samara Halperin and other local filmmakers, and Jean Genet’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chant d’Amour</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  In 2009 we incorporated visuals in our concert at the Meridian Music: Composers in Performance Series at the Meridian Gallery in San Francisco.  I began to introduce some of my own work as a filmmaker into JCDE programming.  In June of 2010 </span><a href="http://www.submergedqueerspaces.com/SQS_Site/Video.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we did a big performance with an early cut of my experimental documentary, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Submerged Queer Spaces, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">at the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">African American Arts and Culture Complex in San Francisco CA as part of the National Queer Arts Festival.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Really, as a composer or ensemble, you will bring in a larger, wider audience in collaboration with filmmakers or with public-domain silent films that people know, like The Golem.  There’s a lot of groups doing live music for film.  It’s something that has a very direct, simple appeal.  Sometimes, with a new music group, it’s difficult to describe what the concert will be like.  But, if you’re doing a live score event, you describe the film, and people get it right away.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: What do you find most constraining and most liberating or inspiring in doing this kinds of shows?</span></i></p>
<p>Jack: <span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important constraint is rights and permissions and clearances.  You have to use a public domain print.  Well, guess what, if a private company like Kino International or Criterion has restored a film, they own that restoration. So you need to get a public domain copy, an unrestored cut of the film.  That, or pay a screening fee.  So, that’s definitely a constraint.  You also need a certain kind of venue, one with a screen or a huge white wall that you can project on.  You cannot just set up and do a show in a bar or café like Classical Revolution.  The venue has to be a good one for projecting a film.  JCDE has its own projector, so it’s not necessary for the venue to have a projector, but they need to have a good place to throw the image.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>I guess what’s most liberating is the constraint of the film itself: by having creative demands put upon you, such as following the narrative of the film, it guides you, but also liberates you.</strong>  You can do whatever you like, as long as it works with the film.  If you have no constraints, it’s like being trapped by having too much freedom.  You don’t know what to worry about.  What should I write?  But by having the film provide a very rigid temporal structure, that gives you the freedom to do whatever you like within that form and structure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The film itself has to be the main inspiration.  So what is inspiring, that would be the film.  You don’t want to select a film that is boring or uninspiring.  It’s easier to do a film that suggests all kinds of musical possibilities.  The Golem is a very complex film, but there’s all kind of gestural acting and complex subplots going on that suggest certain musical approaches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Diego: What characterizes a great live music for film score? And what a performance?</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jack: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a tough question; I can more easily tell you about some terrible ones I’ve seen, without naming names.  There have been some bands and performers from the rock and popular music worlds that have done live scores for films, and while some have been good, some have been terrible because they were stuck in the concept of the “song.”  And by song I mean just that: a binary AB verse-chorus structure in regular 8 or 16 bar patterns. So the opening sequence is one “song.” Then the next scene or two is another “song.”  Or if it’s not a “song,” then it’s a groove or a jam.  And the resulting score is just a chain of “songs,” like when you play Dark Side of the Moon to Wizard of Oz. It’s cool for a while, but after the first 50 minutes, it’s tiresome.  Structurally, films are not a chain of songs, and while you can subdivide a film that way, it’s like trying to force a square peg into a round hole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I guess I’d say <strong>a great live score is one that understands the film, and adds something to the experience.  It helps the audience understand and process the silent film.</strong> As far as performance, the audience is going to watch the screen, not the ensemble, so there’s no need for gratuitous posing or flamboyant soloing. You do what serves the film.  <strong>What makes a great performance is when the players are really well prepared, and know the film really well, so they hit their mark perfectly.  So there’s no hesitation with the improv.</strong>  For example, if an instrument has to represent what a silent film actor is saying or doing gesturally, they need to be right on that, they need to know with confidence where that happens and how they want to play that moment.</span></p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O-qXfG5wbSc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2 id="improvisation-and-film-music">Types of improvisation that are well suited for film</h2>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: How do you use improvisation in this contexts?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jack: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s all kinds of improvisation approaches that we use. Most of it is “structured improvisation,” with the film providing the structure, and the players are free to play anything within certain guidelines dictated by the narrative. I will go over some of the more specific improvisatory techniques that we use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For The Golem, I’ve composed several themes. They are fully notated, and written out in one to three parts.  So in the score I can specify, for example, certain instruments will play “Theme A.”  Or I will have a solo instrument play a fragment of theme A.  The player can choose the fragment themselves and how to play it, what tempo or emphasis or variation of that fragment. Or I might have two instruments play a duet based upon theme A. These are <strong>improvisations, based upon existing melodic material that I have supplied.</strong>  So it gives the player freedom, but also keeps things coherent.  I’m not micro-managing. A good player can come up with a variation of a melody.  And of course we have rehearsals in which a lot of this gets worked out, seeing what works and what doesn’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain<strong> accompanying textures may be completely improvised</strong>. So if we want the sound of wind, or of cold, or of heat, or of fire, certain instruments can do that nicely, and those textures can be specified in the score but then freely improvised by the player.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain <strong>visual gestures can be imitated with music, a technique often called “mickey-mousing.”</strong> It just means a player should follow that onscreen action closely. So if I write for doublebass, “MM Golem footsteps,” the player will hit those footsteps. This “MM” is really effective to do with dialogue, which is often delivered in exaggerated gestures in silent film. In one scene, Miriam is whining to her father, Rabbi Jehuda, who angrily barks back at her.  So these gestures, whining and barking, are easily improvised and imitated by instruments.  There’s no need to write out a precise part for the player; it’s much more fun for the player to improvise this themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One kind of improvisation<strong> I tend to avoid or use sparingly is that sort of jazz or rock improvisation style of playing over preset chord changes.</strong> This tends to fall into what Derek Bailey called “idiomatic” improvisation, and it is often predictable or boring, and harkens back to that jam-band kind of scoring which I dislike. There’s places where it comes in handy, but <strong>I favor free improvisation, structured improvisation, improvisation based upon supplied melodic material, and textural and gestural improvisation.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also, of course, improvisation based upon graphic notation; I tend to use that more in my concert music than I do in live film scores. I think the reason graphic notation is more suited to concert music has to do with available space on the page, page turns, and rehearsal time. Also there’s less of a reason to draw a pictograph when there’s already plenty of visual cuing on the screen already in a film.</span></p>

<h2 id="aspects-of-film-music">Structure, dialogue and other aspects of film music</h2>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How is your work process different when working with films, as opposed to working solely with music?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jack: The compositional process is similar, with the main difference being the handling of form and structure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you study any kind of composition, one of the things you study is form and structure.  This is true whether this is musical composition, poetry, prose, or architecture.  Form and structure is often supplied by established conventions: maybe I’m writing a sonnet, or a sonata, or a theme-and-variations, or an opera.  Maybe I’m writing a TV commercial, or a piece for organ that will unfold over 10 centuries.  In any case, a trained composer will approach a piece with an idea of the form and structure.  It’s like the architect who builds a house, and the first thing he thinks about might not be the façade, but the frame. What holds it up? How big is it?  What’s the pacing or the overall size and shape?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a film, that basic structure comes supplied. You know how long the film is, where the “acts” are dramatically, what are the important scenes, the “tentpoles”, and what is transitional. A film solves most musical problems of form and structure, and allows you to concentrate on other areas, like themes, development, texture, mood, arrangement, and orchestration.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: Besides structure, which aspects of the film do you pay most attention to  when writing the music? And how do you approach each of them? </span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am very sensitive to visual issues and dramatic issues. What needs emphasis? Where are the storylines? What is important? What needs to be indicated?  For example, in The Golem, Miriam is looking dreamily out the window.  Unless we are really paying attention, or have watched the film a hundred times, we might miss that she is looking at her lover Florian, offscreen, in the street below. Playing the love theme can signpost what is going on in her head.  For another example, when Florian shows the Emperor’s seal to the guard at the ghetto gate, the audience might not understand that the seal belongs to the Emperor and that’s what gives Florian the ability to travel wherever he wants. So, the Emperor’s theme can indicate that. Music will remind the audience where the seal comes from and its political importance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a tendency to approach these moments with what are called “tropes,” or basic musical gestures the audience understands. These tropes go back to opera, to theatre music, to the troubadours and storytelling, they are very old and recognizable. Everyone has heard pizzes used for tip-toes sneaky music, and agitato chase music, for example. You can approach things in so many ways, depending upon what you would like to emphasize. Are we following the action that we can see, or are we indicating that there’s something else happening outside the frame? Are we playing the point of view of one character or another?  Do we need to emphasize emotion, or maybe just the time of day or how cold it is?  Certain scenes might be tonally ambiguous, and you can play things up, or keep them small. There’s just so many approaches, and I think it helps to decide how you want the film to play.  As far as musical approaches, it’s whatever works, whatever is interesting. There should be no limitations musically, as long as it’s working with the film.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you always see the music as supporting the film or do you aim at establishing other types of relationships to it, producing music which might at times diverge from the film&#8217;s intentions (commenting, contradicting, etc.)?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jack: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First of all, there’s a huge history of what you describe, going back to the “film funners” of the silent period, as described in Rick Altman’s important book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silent Film Sound</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  These were cinema accompanists, typically organists and pianists, who specialized in making fun of a film by accompanying it with comedic music, much like the “Mystery Science Theatre” television program. So instead of supporting the film, they were trying to tear it down and make the audience laugh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider also </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dark Side of the Rainbow</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the legendary underground VHS tape and DVD that post-synchronizes Pink Floyd’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dark Side of the Moon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wizard of Oz</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  It’s cute and clever, but it gets pretty tiresome once the album needs to start repeating itself to cover the length of the film.  The first few reels are pretty fascinating though, and show us how independent narrative structures of concept album and feature film can surprisingly align temporally just by chance or happy accident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also an academic notion or theory of ‘counterpoint’ in music for visual media, which is to say, music that goes unexpectedly against the visual, for example scoring a combat scene not with action music, but with sad music; there’s a well-known example of this in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Platoon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  So the film becomes a commentary on the horror of war, rather than a typical action movie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Golem</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we are treating the film entirely with respect.  There’s little funny moments in it, but overall we are trying to support the film, not undermine it.  </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Golem </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is powerful cinema, and our intention is to support Paul Wegener’s original vision and to help communicate the story effectively to the audience, whether or not they have seen the film before.  Since it’s a public domain film, there’s a version of it online that has some pretty random classical music dumped in everywhere, and that version of the film makes little sense, because the music is so meaningless or confounding. <strong> We are trying to make the film come alive by having appropriate music, music that works with the film.</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Diego: And about ensembles, what kinds of instrumentation do you think are better for live music for film, and which size of an ensemble would you suggest as ideal (if any)?</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s driven by a number of variables, as you might expect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One is the performance space: how many players can it hold, what is the set up there? Do they have a projector and a screen, where are those, or if we bring in our own gear, where does it need to go?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another is budget. Not only in terms of money per player, but also in terms of the number of “services,” how many rehearsals there can be based upon time and money, and how much rehearsal time there is available.  A larger ensemble might need more rehearsal time, or they might just need a simpler score, in the same way that large ensemble music differs from chamber music.  Things that are complex, virtuosic, or more specific to a particular technique will warrant more rehearsal time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JCDE, pretty early in our inception, did concerts at ATA in San Francisco that just were two players: Fred Morgan on drums and percussion, and myself on Roland Jupiter 6 analogue synthesizer and electric bass.  That was pretty minimal; so live music for film can be done with a small ensemble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instrumentation depends on the film, but I’m also thinking about what </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">types</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of players to bring in on a show.  For </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Golem</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we need players that can improvise in the techniques and styles I’ve described above.  For </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Golem</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we also benefit from clarinet, which can invoke a klezmer sound, and can also imitate a shofar, which is necessary as it appears visually in the film.  Our clarinetist, Alicia Byer, does this amazing job of imitating a shofar on a clarinet, you cannot tell that it’s not the real thing.  It’s absolutely unbelievable.  Trade secret!  </span></p>

<h2 id="rehearsal–and-performance">Rehearsal and Performance</h2>
<p><em>Diego: How does your rehearsals look like?</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our rehearsal schedule depends upon if the piece has been done before and the familiarity of the players with the piece.  When we first debuted </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Golem</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in March 2015, we had three rehearsals.  The first rehearsal was meant to just get through the whole thing, stopping any time when needed, trying out different approaches in rough spots, and making sure everything worked.  So the first rehearsal is about getting people familiar with the score, making sure everything works, and settling on the approach we will take for every moment of the film. The second rehearsal we attempt to get through the whole thing without stopping, but likely stopped a few times and ironed out some rough patches.  The third rehearsal was a dress rehearsal. No stopping, no fixing, going through the whole show. Afterwards we might have hit some spots, but the main thing in a dress rehearsal is to run through the whole show.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we do repeat performances, we will have fewer rehearsals.</span></p>
<p><em>Diego: How do you prepare a performance (where is the best place to set the ensemble, how do you dress, interaction with the audience, etc.)?</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For live music to projected cinema, concert black is a good way to go.  We all have stand lights, and otherwise the only light should be from the screen. You don’t want to block the screen for the audience, but you also want to preserve good sight lines so the ensemble can see each other and see the screen as well.  That’s particularly important for the “mickey-mousing” improvisation that needs to synchronize tightly on screen action.  If physical space in the venue allows, we tend to go on either side of the screen, facing the screen, and facing each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s generally not much audience interaction, although sometimes we can get the audience to scream during the onscreen earthquake, for example. Although it is a live music event, primarily people are coming to see the film and want to engage with the film.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Golem</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we all wore these tall, black, pointy hats, as you might be able to see in some of our PR photos that were taken</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">t the show at HM157 in March, 2015.  That’s because the Jews in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Golem</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, at least all the men, all are wearing these big black hats, and we thought that would be a fun thing to do, to have us be kind of “part” of the film visually as well as musically.  When we walk out on stage, some people might get it right away, and then everyone will certainly get it once they see the film.  For me, Alicia gave me this crazy “wizard” hat to wear, and, I don’t want to give anything away, but it really complemented the film.</span></p>
<p><em>Diego: What is the most important thing (or things) to keep in mind when doing live music for film?</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re doing it to enhance the film.  If you are a band, don’t play a bunch of your songs and use the film as a pretty backdrop. I mean, you can, but then you have Pink Floyd.  I love Pink Floyd, but, most bands are not Pink Floyd. Support the film. Know the film. Every detail. Understand the film.</span></p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YCVpI6WgwCM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>
<p><em>Diego: Are there any musicians or composers that you would consider as important references for musicians engaging in live music for film?</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_cBzuFyx-c" target="_blank">Clubfoot Orchestra</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZkvjWIEcoU" target="_blank">Alloy Orchestra</a> have both been doing this type of program for a long time.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/AFV14KXA_ew?list=PLfEoPk1dqwLMc_9CZP9e-HMei_Y4I4jM6" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuxedo Moon did a very nice score to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pink Narcissus</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that is available limited edition on LP; I’ve not seen their live score for the film, but the music is very textured and sensitive and enjoyable.</span></p>
<p><em>Diego: What musician(s) would you like to recommend?</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jack:Tough question, because I think people should discover things for themselves, or if one makes recommendations, one should do that based upon knowledge of the particular needs of the recommendee, what it is they are missing from their collection. <a href="https://newamsterdamrecords.bandcamp.com/music" target="_blank">New Amsterdam Records</a>, <a href="https://bedroomcommunity.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Bedroom Community Records</a>, almost anything out of Iceland or Brooklyn, those are the correct answers right now. You have to know what these folks are doing because they have momentum. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYpkGvtZzbM" target="_blank">Mason Bates</a>, <a href="https://nicomuhly.bandcamp.com/album/mothertongue" target="_blank">Nico Muhly</a>, those are among the rising stars of today’s generation. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTlGnhGYXHw" target="_blank">Bang on a Can</a>, who have been around for a long time now, started a movement towards collectives that is now realized in other groups like <a href="http://wildup.la/" target="_blank">WildUp in Los Angeles</a>. There is a lot going on, and often it’s not a particular musician, but groups of musicians who share affiliations geographically or structurally through these organizations.  <a href="https://youtu.be/LRQBoIYMvu8" target="_blank">There’s a smaller group here in LA called WasteLAnd and they have been doing interesting shows</a>; one of their directors,<a href="https://populistrecords.bandcamp.com/album/scott-worthington-prism" target="_blank"> bassist Scott Worthington, just released a beautiful new solo CD called </a></span><a href="https://populistrecords.bandcamp.com/album/scott-worthington-prism" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prism</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which is on <a href="https://populistrecords.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Populist Records, a boutique label that promotes new music.</a> I also would recommend going to a used record store and buying a bunch of old LPs with covers you like.  If the album or its music is not posted on YouTube, buy it. So much important music has never been re-released on CD or digitally, for example early electronic music on Nonesuch or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTU3h92xXOw" target="_blank">improvisatory chamber music by Lukas Foss</a>, and so on.  There’s tons of important “new music” and avant-garde and experimental music out there waiting to be discovered and re-discovered.  But just to reiterate, it’s really difficult for me to make recommendations unless I know someone, as a student or a friend, and know where their head is at.  I think our appreciation of the arts is very unique, and I don’t think everyone needs to like the same thing, and everyone has certain areas where they don’t adequately know the rep, myself included.  It’s great to talk about music and art and culture with people and discover gaps in knowledge and new areas for discovery.</span></p>
<p><b></b><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: How about books?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jack: I read so much, I go through a lot of stuff, I have quite a library. If there are students reading this, I’d recommend, when you are starting out, you need a good orchestration book, and you need to write in it all your observations in your own words, about what works and what doesn’t.  You should annotate your orchestration book so it makes sense to you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently I’m reading Sheppard’s biography of Brian Eno. That has got me to go back and listen to tons of Eno and to complete my collection. Especially I’ve been enjoying his collaborations with German musicians, such as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOCSkXzLRJs" target="_blank">Cluster &amp; Eno</a></span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGhsBmKvaQA" target="_blank">After The Heat</a></span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, even more so since Dieter Moebius died this year, sadly, a great musician and a great innovator. Also </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIkN8DnYh9E" target="_blank">Musik von Harmonia</a></span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. All that music bridges so many approaches and is so under-appreciated.  Also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ6beji4I4" target="_blank">Gavin Bryars, I got a copy of his </a></span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ6beji4I4" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homages</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ6beji4I4" target="_blank"> LP</a>, and it is brilliant.  He’s also connected to<a href="http://boingboing.net/2015/02/13/listen-to-all-ten-albums-from.html" target="_blank"> Eno through the Obscure label</a>, although you may know him through </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT0wonCq_MY" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jesus’ Blood, </span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT0wonCq_MY" target="_blank">his piece for tape and orchestra</a>.</span></p>

<p>[This is an excerpt from the <a href="http://goes/ into detail about he he managed to successfully fund his experimental music opera, Heaven Down Here.">full interview with composer, pianist and improviser Andrew Jamieson</a>. In this part goes into detail on how  he managed to successfully fund his experimental music opera, Heaven Down Here.]</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ueTEwx_Gdss" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://Check%20out/ Andrew's successful campaign on IndieGogo" target="_blank">Check out Andrew&#8217;s successful campaign on IndieGogo</a></p>
<p class="western"><em>Diego: I think it’s quite amazing the way that you got funding for your opera. Could you tell how did you managed to do that?</em></p>
<p class="western">Andrew: Oh yeah, thanks. It was a quite an experience. I learned a lot, I wish that I had known before. So, one thing that I regret, I´m just going to throw it right away is that I only used this sort of crow founding, <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/" target="_blank">Indiegogo</a>, which is equivalent to <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> and others; and I depended entirely on them; which means that I didn’t tap into the conventional grants that are still out there. What I’m seeing now is that people have a “do all of the above” approach.</p>
<p class="western">I’m not sure how many people are able to fund their projects entirely with conventional grants but they are out there and since I didn&#8217;t use one, I didn’t have as much fundings as I could’ve had, <b>so I would first of all encourage everyone not to use something like Indiegogo or Kickstarter as a replacement for the conventional grants.</b> However I did use Indiegogo with a lot of success.<strong> I set an $8,000 dollar goal and raised just about exactly that amount. So one lesson in there is the goal is important and it makes a difference. It could well determine how much you raise.</strong></p>
<p class="western"><em>Diego: So how did you determine the goal?</em></p>
<p class="western">Andrew: <strong>The goal really should primarily come from how much money you need for the project.</strong> For example, I knew that I needed to hire about twenty performers and I wanted them all to receive something and I knew that would run over $5,000 dollars total, which it did. So, I had, you know, if I had only set 5000 dollars as a goal or a less than that. I guess I was slightly under 5000, it was more than half of the budget. So<strong> if my goal was under that amount then I wouldn&#8217;t have as much credibility, because even if I make the goal, I’m still gonna be underfunded.</strong> It’s possible to raise them with the crowdfunding platforms are set up, it’s possible to raise for more a new goal and that does happen. <strong>At some point I thought that maybe if I set my goal lower than what I needed then people would surpass the goal but that is not what happened, and I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t follow with that idea. I had eight thousand dollar goal and I got about eight thousand dollars.</strong></p>
<p class="western"><strong>Second, in Indiegogo you set a [proper] time frame for your campaign,</strong> I set it for thirty days which, I think was the right decision, and that’s definitely what they recommend for a medium level crowdfunding campaign. First I thought it should be longer but any <strong>longer than that would be a problem because you lose the momentum, you lose interest.</strong> It might work if I was trying to raise maybe twenty thousand, that would give some extra time for things to come together and people to come forward and spread the word, but for eight to ten thousand, if there’s sixty days then it is too long.</p>
<p class="western">Thirty days was about the right amount of time, but you know, two or three days before the deadline I was around $6,000 dollars. A lot of people gave at the beginning and then things kinda dropped off for most part, then things picked near the second half of the campaign but two days before I was still at six thousand and then shout out for the last day. You know, <b>people are watching, people also procrastinate, people wait till the very last minute, and you have to remind them, because a lot of people wanna do it, but they’re busy. They might be thinking “I wanna make sure that I can make a small contribution to help kinds of things happen” but they forget or they put it off, not because they are out of funds but because they are busy. Everyone’s gonna do that, but people have to know “okay now is your time”. A lot of procrastinators dropped in on the last day and then it shot up almost two thousand dollars in the last day, or in the last couple days. </b>A few people, not a lot but a few people gave something extra near the end, many more people were prepared to give something extra and did not, because they wanted to wait for other people to step up, which they did. That’s why the goal was so important. If those people saw that I only needed six thousand then my real goal might not have happened, or maybe if I had said that I needed $10,000, some of these people actually would’ve steped up, so the goal truly makes the huge difference.</p>
<p class="western">By the way, Indiegogo, you do have an incentive to make your goal which is why people are tempted to make the goal lower, because they do take a percentage of what you’ve raised, that’s how they fund their operations and the percentage goes down when you make your goal. And also <strong>there&#8217;s a little secret about Indiegogo and it is that they can actually partner with<a href="https://www.fracturedatlas.org/" target="_blank"> Fractured Atlas, an organization which offer various services that are very useful for artists, and one of them is these tax deductible spending accounts.</a> People can give to them, directly to the account, and then they get a tax deduction for it, so they make the contributions for your campaign tax deductible.</strong> They do not partner with Kickstarter, and that was the biggest reason I didn’t use Kickstarter. But just, just in case people are, people want to know that the whole truth about this, the way that it works when Indiegogo and Fractured Atlas partner, is that they take the same percentage whether you make your goal or not. That’s just what they worked out between the two of them and then they split their funds. It’s a good deal, it’s not, I think it’s about seven percent total between the two organizations so it’s better. In Kicksarter you ended up with about twelve percent if you make your goal. So, I would recommend this better arrangement. You do have to go through paperwork for actual people to read in order to get approved for an account. The bar’s not that high but they need to know that you’re doing legitimate art with the public service and with some kind of the public access component to it, like your concert. That would make it tax deductible. I was set back about a month because I didn’t knew that I needed to go through that paper work, they are on a monthly schedule so they can only approve you once a month. Indigogo will automatically approve you but they’ve not really gonna be tax deductible.</p>
<p class="western">Another thing I would say is that <strong>a lot of people expect to find total strangers, people on the internet, who are looking to give money to projects, and that is definitely not true. What makes something like Indiegogo work is using the people that you already know and creating a platform to bring all of them together and help support you. That’s why our conventional grants are good, because that’s money that’s outside of who you know, of the communities you are connected to.</strong> Then you don’t have to depend entirely on the resources of your own personal support network. You can actually do that, but you have to be intentional about contacting people in your own network. Many of them won’t come through but many of them will. <strong>I wrote lots of personal e-mails, by the way, to everybody that I knew. You have to be prepared for that, but even with many people ignoring it, enough people responded so that I still got where I needed to be. A few people will respond in unfriendly ways and you have to be prepared for that too. Don’t let it scare you away, what you’re doing is still important and you need to trust that even if there’s people who in the end won’t give you any money, many of them will still upport what you’re doing.</strong></p>
<p class="western">There’s one last thing to it that I should add. When I started no one gave less than twenty dollars and more often than not people were giving like fifty or a hundred dollars. It wasn’t that many people but when they did do it was something substantial. <b>I think people can be afraid to give less than that, or embarrassed. So, what happens is, you know, all these people who would’ve been happy to give you one or two or five dollars, didn’t do it, they didn’t step up.</b> So, that’s a challenge. <b>What I did was a “Dollar Donor Day”</b> that I invented. I had a neighbor Terri Odabi, the jazz singer who happened to live across the street from me, she had a campaign at the same time and she kind of copied my idea a few days afterword but she came up with a catchier name for it: <b>“A two dollar Tuesday’’, I like that. Then two days later, of course, she did “A three dollar Thursday’’. One of the advantages is also that some people would say “oh, well, I don’t have to just give one dollar, I have two or three I can give you” or more often “I have five or ten or twenty” or “I have means to give fifty, haven’t done it yet, so today’s my day to do that”.</b> So during that period of time I got a lot of people signing on, I think I was able to double the amount of people who had given during that period of time and you should also look at that as success, because they are getting invested in your project, and that also counts a big deal.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Composer, pianist, and improviser, Andrew Jamieson has been creating music that radically explores contemporary racial and religious topics to their full extent (such as white privilege in religious communities). In this interview we talk about the philosophy behind some of his most recent works, <em>Heaven Down Here, </em>and opera based on the Jonestown Massacre, and Heard The Voice, a solo piano work which enters into conversation with black spiritual music.</p>
<p>In the second part of the interview we talk about the relationships between religion and experimental music, mainly focusing in the etymology of the word radical (which comes from root) and how that idea can applied in relation to the exploration of music and musical instruments.</p>
<p>And for the third part of the interview Andrew goes into detail about how he managed to rise $8,000 USD to fund Heaven Down Here.</p>

<p class="western"><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Diego Villaseñor: Can you tell us about your latest works that revolve around religious topics: </span></em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Heaven Down Here</span><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">, your chamber opera, and your new release </span></em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Heard The Voice</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">?</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Andrew Jamieson: <em>Heaven Down Here</em> is an avant-gospel chamber opera that had been formulating inside me for about six years. I, out of the blue, discovered Jim Jones and People’s Temple. It was something I knew nothing about until I was 21 or 22 years old. Suddenly I encountered the name of Jim Jones and the scenario of the Jonestown massacre in </span><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span lang="zxx"><span style="color: #00000a;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Guyana,</span></span></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"> in which almost a thousand people died from drinking </span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">cyanide</span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">&#8211;</span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">laced Kool-Aid </span></span></em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">under the leadership of Jim Jones. And then I found out more about this whole movement and the community that it represented. It was a movement that I could have identified with had I been around at the time, during the sixties and seventies. I mean that in so many ways: with the way they identified with progressive politics, with socialism, with antiracism and also because it was mostly a black community and movement. Jim Jones was white, but the count within the community was between 50 and 90% black. And it also had the spiritual component from where I, too, came out: the Christian tradition and particularly the black church.<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/HDHWEBBrighter-194x300.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-250" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/HDHWEBBrighter-194x300-194x300.png" alt="Heaven Down Here Cover Photo" width="278" height="430" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/HDHWEBBrighter-194x300.png 194w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/HDHWEBBrighter-194x300-62x96.png 62w" sizes="(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px" /></a> </span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">At the time, I discovered this, I was an undergrad at Northwestern University, but my job was as a gospel pianist for two black churches in Evanston, Illinois. There, I became infinitely familiar with the theology and the worship practices, with the music, the energy and the rhetoric of the black church; and I saw all of that happening in People’s Temple. People’s Temple is their organization, which later became Jonestown, while under Jim Jones. I saw all of that happening in People’s Temple, you know, I just connected in so many ways. I had actually just finished a chamber-opera-oratorio called <em>Goldsmith Of The Kingdom</em> which I was performing in Northwestern University, and that summer I’m discovering Jim Jones and People’s Temple and saying “This needs to be my next opera project” . I let it ruminate in my mind for years. I would take notes about it and encountered books and sources about it, I took a class at Northwestern called “Religion And Social Change In The Black Church” or something like that. I took a lot of that information and I just let it sleep for a while.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Finally when I graduated from Mills and I had made connections in that area, with musicians and also churches who were interested in the theme, I got to work. I raised about eight thousand dollars at Indiegogo and worked on composing the music which was designed to sort of represent a certain perspective on the worship at People’s Temple. </span><strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">A lot of the music was based on pre-existing melodies and I would sort of rework them in radical ways to have them sound often cacophonous or the polytonal in the way of Charles Ives music.</span></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><b> I made them into this dialogue that represents all the different tensions, the feelings of great hope and inspiration that people found there, and also the profound fear and, ultimately, the abuse and destruction that went on there. All those things interacting with one another, and I tried to use different musical elements from the original songs and mixed them with freely improvised dissonant playing, atonal composition, singing and dance.</b></span></p>
<p class="western"><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Diego: What was it about the massacre that compelled you to write and to think about it, to get deep into subject?</span></em></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Andrew: You know, it’s hard to read about what happened and recount the events in Jonestown in its last days, and not be taken by the drama of it: the way things started, and how he was preparing them for this moment and when he finally killed them. Just how everything built up to the final days when congressman Leo Ryan came and was shot&#8230; and then immediately after that, the massacre was under way. That drew me, in terms this is drama that deserves to be exploited in music. But also seeing so much of myself in that and thinking that it could’ve been me, it could’ve been me in Jonestown, you know. And even seeing certain parts of myself in Jim Jones as a white man who works with black spiritual communities now: navigating the power dynamic there, being aware that in a racist society, I ended up having this higher position or extra power without even trying to. Jim Jones had that and abused it, you know, and I was thinking about&#8230;<br />
</span></p>
<p class="western"><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Diego: You needed to make it conscious?</span></em></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Andrew: Yeah, I wanted to explore it, I wanted to see what I would discover about it. I learnt a lot and now I&#8217;m more conscious and articulate. I wanted people to share what I was going through, taking this project to the audience.</span></p>
<p class="western"><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Diego: Do you think that the approaches and technics of experimental music that you used were useful tools for expressing that drama?</span></em></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Andrew: I found them most useful in couple ways. <strong>One was related to the history of People’s Temple, they were actually very experimental in their identity. They were trying all these new things that really hadn’t been tried before, and unfortunately some of them were pretty terrible things</strong> like sessions of so called catharsis where Jim Jones would try to get people to talk about things in a new way, you know, with a lot of violence and abuse being perpetrated. There was experimentation too in parts of their ideology: men taking their wife’s last names, radical feminism, radical anti-racism which tried to turn the tables, racially, and get black people more power than white people.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><strong>To me that just has a lot to do with what we do as experimental musicians. We’re challenging the establishment and the expectations that we have in our society and our culture; we’re challenging them head on, we’re defying them.</strong> We threw out the idea of a time and key signatures, and the idea of pitch and harmony altogether. We threw that out, and come up with this radically new response solution to it, which turns everything upside down, in the way, I think Jim Jones was supposed doing&#8230; Part of what </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><b>I wanted to do was to use this as a meditation and as a self critique; as a warning about what can go wrong,</b></span> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><b>looking at the dangers of being an experimentalist, the dangers of throwing out the conventions of a society that isn’t perfect and is responsible for lot of injustice but also holds us accountable</b></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">. It keeps us from going crazy like Jim Jones and keeps us from abusing others in the way that he did and having a thousand people that we have control over. The society and the conventions in our culture are designed to keep us accountable. And when we ignore and resist any accountability to society, we run those risks. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><b>I think being an experimentalist has great potential but also great risk and it’s important to explore all. I think it&#8217;s important to be experimenting, innovating and trying new ways of listening and performing, but we also have to be aware of that there could be unintended consequences to what we’re doing and that being uncountable isn’t the answer.</b></span></p>
<p class="western"><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/HDH2-300x225.jpg"><img class="wp-image-251 alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/HDH2-300x225-300x225.jpg" alt="Heaven Down Here" width="429" height="322" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/HDH2-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/HDH2-300x225-128x96.jpg 128w" sizes="(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px" /></a>Diego: So which do you think are the dangers that lurk within experimental music, because at first sight it would seem to be innocuous?</span></em></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Andrew: First of all I think it’s important to acknowledge all the ways the experimental music really is innocuous. It’s important to acknowledge that you rarely if ever hear it at a major concert hall, there is not lot of money in it. Very few people make their living entirely off experimental music and many who do just don’t make much money and they’re living in ways that musicians who are even more conventional, wouldn&#8217;t be living in.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">You know, few people think they even like it at all, it’s considered to be very inaccessible. Almost by design it can be a little bit inaccessible. And it&#8217;s thought to be designed to not reach the masses, but to be this really individualistic form of expression, very esoteric and intellectually rich. It&#8217;s so rich that you have to get through all of these different layers of these ideas of sounds, gestures and obscure traditions. We have to know all of those things in order to start, to begin to appreciate what’s going on, so it’s important to recognize that that makes it innocuous in a certain way. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">However, <strong>I’ve been very interested in focusing on the work of composers of color in this country, particularly black composers. Many of them are also aspiring to this same kind of experimental aesthetic that I am as a white composer.</strong> People like<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscoe_Mitchell" target="_blank"> Roscoe Mitchell</a>, and people from his circles in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Creative_Musicians" target="_blank">AACM (Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians)</a>, people who came out of that like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wadada_Leo_Smith" target="_blank">Leo Smith</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lewis" target="_blank">George Lewis</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Braxton" target="_blank">Antony Braxton</a>. So we know that there’s this group of black composers who are aspiring for that. A small number have found certain kind of success but there’s always, always this push back by the white establishment to keep it as so.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Because with so many limited resources in experimental music, you know, with so many limits on who can get venue and what funding, <strong>I think it’s easy for us in the dominant culture to kind of cling to our position and to maintain our privilege to experiment. I think that we, usually subconsciously and unintentionally, end up shutting out people who aren’t part of our dominant culture. I have seen Roscoe Mitchell at Mills be dismissed by white colleagues and students.</strong> To be fair he’s not terribly an academic person but, it&#8217;s not just his academic rigor but his way of thinking and even sometimes his current music that gets criticized. And at the same time I think I can see the pressure that’s been on him to prove that he knows conventions and the traditions. All that in order to be taken seriously in a way that I wouldn’t so much. <strong>I am sort of given a free pass from people who automatically think that I know what I’m doing with whatever I do, while someone like Roscoe Mitchell, who&#8217;s far more experienced, still has to struggle for it.</strong> </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><b>I don’t think we’re gonna have a thousand people die at the hands of an experimental composer, but I do think that for what power there is within the community, it matters, and needs to be used responsibly by who have it.</b></span></p>
<p class="western"><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Diego: Yeah, there are structures of power even in sub-communities such as these.</span></em></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Andrew: That’s what I believe, yeah, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><b>that’s an important part of my philosophy and my politics, and my aesthetics.</b></span></p>
<p class="western"><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Diego: Maybe it’s dangerous to not be conscious of the trends that are dominant and hide this certain trends under the cover of experimentation.</span></em></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Andrew: I think you have to be conscious, I think you have to know what they are but I think you can’t let them have too much influence and too much power. You have to always be looking out for alternatives to what is dominant. And that I think is </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><b>one of the strengths of the experimental musicians, that we always are looking beyond to transcend the dominant culture in general, we’re always looking for alternative paths and I think that’s the real strength and that’s why I do what I do.</b></span></p>
<p class="western"><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Diego: What was the response of the community, in the churches when the opera was performed?</span></em></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Andrew: Well, I don’t think it was very easy for people to experience, although, many people were grateful to experience it. A few people, felt like the music was engaging in a way that they were very hesitant to tell me they enjoyed it. They felt they had to say “I don’t know if I can say that I have enjoyed this because of topic and I don’t wanna enjoy, you know, watching something that is alluding to, you know, the death of a thousand people”. They feel a little bit uneasy and guilty about that. But well,<strong> I’m trying to help them find a certain beauty in telling these stories that need to be told, and helping them discover truths that need to be acknowledged.</strong> </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><b>To me that’s beautiful, to acknowledge what is difficult and painful, to acknowledge and I use that as healing.</b></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">A few chose not the come or had difficulties sitting through it, or in a couple cases were interested in participating and then began to back away from participating because they found it so difficult. One singer in particular told me she was really excited about being involved at the being but then she started backing away and when we finally talked about it she said -this is too hard for me, I take this really seriously and I can’t, I just can’t do it-. So, there was a lot of that happening, I think it sort of kept the project from going quite as far as could have. I don’t think it’s anybody&#8217;s fault, I don’t think it means that the music was not very good or that I was doing the wrong thing. I’m just aware that’s the reality of being human and processing grief is people need sometimes back away from it, keep a distance from it.</span></p>

<h2 id="dialogues-other" class="western">[Conversing with the other]</h2>
<p class="western"><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Diego: And what about </span></em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Heard The Voice</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">,</span><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"> it seems to be a very peculiar take on African American spiritual music.</span></em></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Andrew: First of all since </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><i>Heaven Down Here, </i></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">I’ve been sort of dealing with a lot of the same material, a lot of the same issues: I want to engage in experimental contexts this African American church music which is so familiar and important to me.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">But that’s continued to evolve. In the beginning I was groping around in the dark, trying figure out how on earth I was gonna bring these two things together, and recently it clicked. <strong>It occurred to me that this is a conversation. So </strong></span><strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><i>Heard the Voice</i></span></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><strong> is about the voice that this spirituals represent. A voice of the experience of opression and a voice of the African cultures that influenced the spirituals, and also the voice of this transformative faith. And I recognize that that voice is not my voice. I don’t really identify with those things in the way that the writers of the spirituals did, it’s not my voice, but I can converse with that voice.</strong> Once I figured that out, I could take it head on. The title came form a line on one of the songs that I’ve arranged and dialoged with, which is </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">“heard the voice of Jesus say, there’s said “remember the next one, the verse” but it’s about Jesus saying “come and fallow me and keep your hands on the plow and hold on, just on and keep remaining faithful to what you’re doing.” </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Because the voice that I hear this spirituals is not an innocuous voice, it’s a voice calling us to this great responsibility and the song “hand on the plough”, it’s all the profound implications of this calling. and </span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">So that kinda illustrates what I’m trying to do with these spirituals. But on more technical aspects, I use the original melody as one layer and then I’m trying bring other layers into a conversation. And I’m trying to explore where is the common ground between them and when can they come together. But also where is the tension between them, when do they sound kinda awkward when they come together?</span></p>
<p class="western"><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Diego: So, you have these two traditions, the African American tradition and the other which is maybe your own tradition and your own upbringing, and you’re trying to explore how they can interact and how they and create something new.</span></em></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Andrew: Absolutely. You’ve got it. And as you said that it occurred to me that<strong> I really struggled with how I approached the process of arranging these; because I think that conventional ideas on making an arrangement intend to make it a single piece with a single statement and a single voice. What happens a lot of times, especially among white composers and arrangers, its that they’ll approach a music like this and use it, and try start to define what they think that song is and they won’t distinguish between how the song was before they arranged it, what material they knew before they arranged it and what they’ve added to it. A lot of people are not acknowledging what their contribution was. I find that kinda dangerous, when someone from the dominant culture is appropriating this music for their purposes because you know, we can’t trust them on being authentic. I don’t pretend to be true to the original intention of this music and I make that explicit. </strong></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">I was worried about defining what this music is and end up having my own purposes and interests getting confused with those of the original music. I think that’s very dangerous so I take it very seriously, and work on distinguishing my own voice from the voice of this music.</span></p>
<p class="western"><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Diego: I think that’s like a that shows more profound appreciation for the other music, because you’re not trying to pretend that you know it and it’s part of you, but you’re rather showing how you love it and how you can create with it. On the contrary you are representing the tensions between both worlds.</span></em></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Andrew: Yeah, exactly.</span></p>
<h2 class="western"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5H5dvfklhyg" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></h2>
<h2 id="religion-experimental-music" class="western">[Religion and experimental music]</h2>
<p class="western"><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Diego: So, how do you view the relationship between religion and avant-garde or experimental music?</span></em></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Andrew: I grew up hearing some of it in church, primarily in what we know as the Congregational Church and The United Church of Christ. Mostly what I heard came out of the European or European- American tradition, and I would hear these pretty out-there organ pieces by people like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_Messiaen" target="_blank">[Olivier] Messiaen</a>, and so it always seemed a little bit natural that there is a place for this music and the church, to an extent. On the other hand I was always told that this music was weird and that a lot of people didn’t like it; so I was always a little bit afraid to go too far. You know, I still have that and I’m still afraid in a worship setting to go a little bit too far. But I really started to own the relationship between the two when I started reading Messiaen and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage" target="_blank"> John Cage</a>.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">I think before I read them I was a little uneasy about both sides of this equation, I was a little been uneasy about whether it can fit with people I was connected, and so I was uneasy about whether or not that was the best use of my energy on the one hand, and on the other hand I was uneasy about whether I was even identifying as religious. I mean, there&#8217;s a time as a young adult, I think where it’s important to really evaluate, where one comes from and ask big questions and I was doing that: asking very big questions. You know, about what can I really believe in integrity. And then <strong>reading Messiaen and seeing his deep faith (that he expresses differently than I do and has different values than I do) and seeing how he can express this faith with this very unique kind of music. And reading about all this imagery that he has in it, made me think “wow, that’s something I could do”.</strong> Regarding John Cage, I started taking on Buddhist practices before I was reading John Cage, and back then I was little unsure if the meditation that I was doing and the philosophy that I was confounding was really compatible with my work as an artist. And then <strong>seeing what John Cage had written about was inspiring: the experience of the silence and the experience of just letting things be and how using music is a way of cultivating the mind set, the same kind of mind set that Buddhist teacher, teachers were aspiring to.</strong></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Then John Cage, his spirituality, became very explicit influences on my music, especially for that years that I was on college at Northwestern. You know reading both of their work, John Cage and Messiaen&#8217;s really put me on this path that I’m still on. But now my interest isn’t always about expressing my own ideas, which is something I think both Messiaen and Cage were doing and I think that that was wonderful, because they were also trying to empower everyone’s perspective, in a community.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><strong>I am trying to bring and build sort of what a lot of communities of faith call building bridges between different communities. I come from a very progressive background which I’m still very committed to, and a lot of the churches that I worked with are on the cutting edge of integrating the LGBT movement, feminist movements and of course civil rights and others, into their spirituality.</strong> Unfortunately the church, in particular the church in United States is a force that fights all those movements. There’s still a racism in the church, and there’s a lot of very open unfair treatment of women in church, in the way the Catholic church still doesn’t integrate women; and even, other denominations that do, a women leaders faces challenges that male leaders don’t. And you know, we’re only now starting to ordain people who are gay, lesbian, transgender and many, many churches will still refuse to do that.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">So we have these activist communities and we have these religious communities that are often at odds with one another and some a lot of churches that are trying to reach out talked about building bridges between various previously separate communities. And how someone with a foot in both worlds or somebody who loves both communities can be that bridge. So I’ve started taking that process and practice of building bridges and using artistic expression to do that, to build bridges between communities of faith and communities of artists.</span></p>
<h2 id="really-new-music" class="western">[Is there ever something really new in music?]</h2>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><em>Diego: So, did you get into experimental music because it is not too codified into certain type of practice, and so it can serve this idea of building bridges?</em></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Andrew: Well, there’s a lot of openness and we’re reconstructing, we’re rebuilding and recreating in the most fundamental way and that’s what we have to do if we want to move forward, I think, as a community. One example, in this idea of creating something new, is that we are not limited anymore to this sort of formal concert setting.<strong> Experimental music challenges this kinds of ideas, you know, the role of the audience and I’ve been really drawn to audience participatory music which creates this common space and common ground which are reminescent to certain worship settings where people are singing and clapping along.</strong> And by the way, audience participation is very radically controlled in the classical music circles and the circles of the dominant culture and I think it’s wonderful that artists who come from that classical tradition are challenging that; people like<a href="http://paulineoliveros.us/" target="_blank"> Pauline Oliveros</a> have created a space for audience participation and that’s what I’m really inspired by. However, other cultures that have been influenced by Africa, have been doing that for a long time. <strong>You go to blues or you go to jazz clubs you&#8217;ll see people are clapping and singing and even rock now has that, there is a lot of that jazz and blues influence in there too. So as I’m talking about audience participation as an experimental gesture, I realize that it’s this European cultural bias that makes that seem experimental.</strong></span></p>
<p class="western"><em>Diego: I think that is very interesting, that experimental music seems to be experimental for us, for our culture, but on the other side it seems that these gestures and sounds, that are so new and attractive for us, have already been there for thousands of years.</em></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">B: Absolutely yeah, well that’s why I’m glad you’re interviewing someone like <a href="http://jakobpek.com/" target="_blank">Jakob Pek</a>, because what<strong> I get from him is this idea that when we do this crazy, weird things, we are actually connecting with something eternal and something you know, really old. And with him I’m always find myself reexamining “is this a new idea that I have or is this an old idea”. </strong></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">However, you said one thing that I also wanted respond to, about how you say that to us these things look radical. Well, part of my background is also have spent a lot of time in high school, college and onward with this experimental music. It doesn’t really sound that weird anymore. Sometimes, Mozart sounds weirder to me then John Cage. So what does it even mean to be weird and what’s comfortable and what’s not. It’s easy, when we’re in these circles that we’re on, to kind of turn all this on its head, but it’s important to take a step back and acknowledge the unique perspective that we have.</span></p>
<p class="western"><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Diego: Yeah. I was thinking about, our society&#8230; and conservatories and universities.</span></em></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Andrew: Yes, they don’t, they don’t change very quickly, right?</span></p>
<p class="western"><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Diego: And, you know there&#8217;s something that happened in many ways in avant-garde and experimental musics, for example as you where saying, that audience participations suddenly became part of our repertoires of techniques, it was a certain expansion of what music could be, but only for the perspective of western classical music; that was already happening in Africa and in many other cultures, and the same goes for many rhythmic, harmonic or formal “innovations”.</span></em></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Andrew: Exactly, yeah, right, exactly.</span></p>

<h2 id="radical-music" class="western">[Radical Music]</h2>
<p class="western"><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Diego: So it&#8217;s interesting to discover that what we are finding and experiencing as new was already there, and in that sense certain ideas of what avant-garde and experimental music is can be misleading, namely that it is a collection of aesthetic ideas that break with western music of previous eras. <strong>To me that is a petrified idea of what that music is all about, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s about breaks at all. In fact, I think that what we are trying to do is to expand our own experience of the world and of our own being; and I think that that is something that for you can be a link between religion and music: because religion can be seen as this practice of growth, of expanded consciousness, of spiritual enrichment.</strong> And somehow avant-garde music and experimental music are also moving on a similar path that goes towards new experiences.</span></em></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Andrew: And I think that in both of them you end up going back something old. Then again this is what I was associating with Jakob Pek, but probably I have this a lot in my own thinking as well, you know, <strong>some things are so old that they seem new.</strong> There&#8217;s a lot of radical Christians who think that if you go back and reexamine what was going 2000 years ago in the time of Jesus or even in another times, a long time ago with Jewish communities before Jesus, or Buddhist communities. You know, these things that were happening thousands of years ago, and if you really take to heart what was happening, it seems radical. And I get this feeling from music, again from someone like Jakob who&#8217;s saying -t<strong>hese things that we’re doing, they seem so radical but they are actually connecting us to our tradition from thousands of years ago-.</strong> What’s weird in that? And we can think about that in comparison with the traditions of music notation of classical music or the instruments that we use, and of twelve tone equal temperament tuning, all these things that are supposedly traditional. They’re quite new in the perspective of human history.</span></p>
<p class="western"><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Diego: And then, you know, just intonation it’s really old.</span></em></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Andrew: Yes, right. You see what I am saying, yeah. I’m going back to what’s old. <strong>They tell me that our word ‘radical’ comes from the word ‘root’, so even in so called movements ‘radical’, you know, radical liberation, radical feminism and womanism and radical everything that we have. If you semantically or linguistically go and look up what they’re talking about, you&#8217;ll see that they’re talking about going back to the root of the issue, they’re not talking about throwing everything out and trying to reinvent the wheel.</strong> They’re talking about going back to what underlies the principles that we all depend on, going back to those and getting rid of this other baggage of society.</span></p>
<p class="western"><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Diego: And then it’s similar to the experience of people who are experimenting, what they might be going through as they play their instrument. One might just hold up an instrument and then explore it without any preconceived notions of how to play it. Then<strong> it&#8217;s about trying to understand what is that thing is. We forget about what it is supposed to be, and then we go to the thing, to what it is or can be.</strong> It&#8217;s like going to its root, right?</span></em></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Andrew: Absolutely, yeah. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">That reminds me of one of my colleagues from Northwestern, Megan Beugger.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"> She&#8217;s an up and coming composer who is devoting her career to redefining how to use these instruments and her&#8217;s is really brilliant work. We started on Northwestern together, and in our first year she was in a class that paired performers and composers together to create a new work during the course. She worked with a timpanist and a violinist, so she ended up with this duo and she was excited for a few moments and then said: -what on Earth am I going to do with a violin and a timpani!&#8230; how am I going to do anything that makes sense with this two instruments, what’s gonna happen?-</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">And then professor Aaron Cassidy said -well you know from my perspective and from the acoustic perspective and the composer’s perspective they are very similar: we’ve got this resonating body and this exciter that produces the vibrations; they both have them and you can use that as a common ground.- By the end of the term she had created a piece that used both instruments in that way: she would hit the violin with the timpani mallet, so it blured the line between the two. And it takes you to back to the root of what these instruments are, we have something that produces the vibrations [the exciter] and something that amplifies this vibrations [the resonator] and that’s what’s going on here. And you can hear that, I think, in all of the music that she’s done since then. You <strong>look at the instruments, not as what they have been traditionally defined but as what they’re actually are.</strong></span></p>
<p class="western"><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Diego: And back to religion, you know religion come from the Greek </span></em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">religare</span><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">, which means to tie, which is somehow that idea. She’s tying back to the instruments, to the roots. </span></em></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Andrew: Yeah, the tying, I think it is also associated with the ordering. We have the integration of everything which I think is a really profound interpretation of that, of that word and that’s what was going on in this piece, and we also have this sort of the ordering, giving you this structure, this format that allows you to do the integration. <strong>The problem with religion is that tying becomes more like bondage and restriction, keeping people from doing anything. So, it’s important again that one can really get back to the root, using this tying as something that will be liberating instead of something that’s confining.</strong></span></p>
<p class="western"><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Diego: Yeah. That’s what conservatism would be right: trying to fix a certain idea and preserving it as something that shouldn&#8217;t, or even couldn&#8217;t be changed. Like to try to think that the root of an instrument is the way it’s played in a certain kind of context.</span></em></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Andrew: Right, as if Paganini defines what the violin is and Chopin the piano. I mean, you have to recognize that composers like them have profoundly shown you something about that instrument, about what I can do, but you have to look at them as the beginning of your own process with those instruments. You can’t look at them as being, you know, being a confining force. They were in their own historical and cultural context and you have to know about that in order to really understand what they’re doing and so it’s important to actually study their tradition, to understand what they were doing, but then it’s also important to use that knowledge to go beyond their domain.</span></p>
<p class="western"><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Diego: Yeah, to be conscious of their contingency.</span></em></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Andrew: Exactly and there&#8217;s contingency in terms of how the context was shaping what these great composers did, but that wasn’t their genius in their composing. It wasn’t these contingencies, these contexts, their genius was what they did with them and how they moved forward.</span></p>
<h2 id="creating-music-exploration" class="western">[Developing new musical techniques and maximizing exploration]</h2>
<p class="western"><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Diego: There were two phrases that I found to be very striking and attractive. I think they’re in the program notes of your albums but I found them on your website. One of them from </span></em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Heaven Down Here</span> <em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">says “composing this piece allowed me to meditate, I wanted to explore.” And the other says in </span></em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Heard The Voice:</span><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"> “music touched me, I mean, it offered hope, renewal, peace and comfort. It may point me to new ways of thinking, living, feeling or being”. So, they are really interesting, especially the parts of talking about composition as a way of producing a meditation and then music as something that points out some new ways of being and thinking and living. </span></em></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">B: Well, you know, in </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><i>Heaven Down Here</i></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"> I think the meditation is a challenge and I think that’s why it was so difficult for people to listen to, and I think that meditation is an element of what I was doing, but if you spend all of your time meditating on the suffering and abuse that happened there, then that’s an incredible weight that you shouldn’t always have to carry. I wanted to share what I was meditating on, so people could understand where I was coming from musically and I don’t think that that piece can be approached only as a meditation and I think it would be very demanding to use it as explicitly as a meditation, I think it would be very demanding emotionally. But I do agree, I would agree if you’re saying that meditation can come out of a particular kind of musical process. I would agree with that. And I would go back and look at John Cage and look at the ways that he talked. He said, he stoped sitting in the conventional Buddhist Zen way that he had learned because he realized that he could get the same effect in his mind by just listening. So, I think that’s important and I think, I aspired to get to that point in my work and naturally I always do.</span></p>
<p class="western"><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Diego: What is really interesting to me is, it seems to like, okay, you choose a topic to compose and then that topic develops and you meditate profoundly upon it as you are doing this composition of the music.</span></em></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Andrew: Yeah, developing of material is a meditation for me and I don’t know if “exploring” stood out for you as that was something that you were quoting but it’s something very important to my experience. You know, I mean there’s nothing more exciting for me than exploration. To be able to go somewhere I’ve never been before, it is very exciting and a very visceral because it produces a lot of adrenaline and a lot of excitement, you know, it feels like my mind becomes very active and it’s very satisfying. It seems that there is no end to what you can explore in music.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">I’m committed to maximizing the sense of exploration in music and in the way that I’ve been creating, you know, like rehearsals, which for me are often very much about exploring, even more so than the performance. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">You know, the composition of music dialogs in <em>Heard The Voice</em>, has been a process of exploration for me and my next step is going to be, to transform these pieces into duos, for two musicians: myself and someone else, and to actually have these two musical voices interact, to have that process be one exploration.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">I’m also in a duo called Nine Fingers, with drummer Dave Douglas. It is actually an allusion to an African dance and you know, in our rehearsals we never quite know what’s gonna happen. We have a set agenda of the pieces we wanna do when we rehearse. But as we do it we explore many different ways of approaching a piece. And I think that’s very typical for an ensemble (especially in new music) who’s trying to reinvent their composition and also trying to reinvent their style.</span></p>

<p class="western"><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Diego: You’ve talked about maximizing exploration, so what do you do to get the best results in this respect?</span></em></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><b>Andrew:  When I explore, even whatever a kind of exploring I’m doing, you know&#8230; the risk is you never quite know what’s gonna happen. You know, the thing that frustrates me about exploring is that you don’t have control over it and it excites me but it&#8217;s also really frustrating to me not to have control over it so when I start to open myself to exploration, it often happens that I lose control and suddenly I can’t find the affects that I want. So, if I want to continue to explore, a particular musical element or idea I find myself quickly unable to remain focused on that idea because I end up in this other place.</b></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><b>Anyway, I think that what gives me the most success with exploring might be exploring a musical scale, taking a particular set of pitches and trying just to see how each, how they sound, holding the pedal down on the piano and playing.</b> I think that it’s fair to say that it becomes as guided exploration, I have a map,<b> I have a system that can give me some rules, guidelines about where I’m going. </b>You know, it’s different, it’s different trying to navigate with GPS. I don’t find it exciting, I kinda resist doing that but, you know, I think there’s a balance you have to find. I think that’s what is about,<b> I think there has to be a balance between having some guidance where you’re going and feeling you’re going in a new direction&#8230; and balance is really difficult. I think it’s all about balance, about not going too far off in one direction. Not ending up in a place that’s so rigid that you don’t have any options but not ending up in a place that’s so free that you just don’t know where you’re gonna go. I don’t know, it’s a tough question, I really don’t think I’ve answered it, but it’s really tough question. </b></span></p>
<p class="western"><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Diego: What I was thinking, while you said this, it that<strong> one of the important things about exploring is to avoid getting frustrated because of exploring.</strong></span></em></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Andrew: Right, right, see what I mean. Yeah and how do you do that or can you even do that. I don’t know, maybe you know how to do that.</span></p>
<p class="western"><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Diego:<strong> I have this idea that when going into a space that you want to explore, you have to kind of have a notion about where you want to go, because if you don’t have a notion and you are just wandering and wandering and wandering then you are going to get frustrated because everything will look the same.</strong></span></em></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Andrew: Well, I’ve meant to tell another story if you wanna put this in here.My parents are ministers, my mom especially continues to work as a pastor of various churches and growing up I have vivid memories of being about ten or eleven and my mom would go to meetings around Western Michigan in various places, usually churches. So I would go to these meetings and, you know, they tried to get child care or whatever, but for some reason I would end up taking the first opportunity to go and wonder around in this new church and explore. I would take that opportunity and I have vivid memories of walking around every space that was opened, and in a church that had a meeting going on and usually not much else, I kinda had it all to myself as a seven, eight or nine year old, you know. By the time I was nine or ten this was one of most exciting experiences in my life, but it’s funny that you’ve mentioned having a goal. In all of my experiences I remember wondering around in these churches, I wanted just to find where the piano was, because all I really wanted was to go and sit down and play the piano. You know, it’s a lot of fun just to see what’s in the building and to see what’s behind this door and that door but you know, at the end of the day I wanna see which one has a piano that I can go and sit down and play until the meeting is finished. And it’s funny, I never thought about it this way before. I have vivid memories of walking around in these new buildings and I have vivid memories finding a piano and sitting down and playing and my parents have to go and find me wherever was the piano to get me off and so now we could go home from the meeting and it’s funny, I never really connected them in this way before. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><b>But that’s kind of what was happening, I had a goal, I knew what I was looking for and the process of finding it was really exciting, and I don’t think I would’ve had this process and I don’t think that exploring would have been quite as a exciting if I didn’t have this goal of looking for a piano.</b></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Diego: Yeah, I think that’s one of the key points. <strong>And then if at some point you get frustrated, then you can go on and do something else that&#8217;s also exploratory but that&#8217;s familiar too… a scale or a chord, perhaps. Or exploring something that you’ll already are in, like a process of exploration that can last for years. So maybe to find this balance is to find point between having a goal and searching and then, you know, when you just get blocked or stumble into a wall or something, simply go to do something else instead of spending your time fighting the momentary dead end.</strong></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Andrew: I like that. You know, I appreciate you saying that, I never quite thought about it that way, actually, because I can be very focused on what I do. So, I really tend to just always have this goal in mind, you know, and I never like to give up. So that can be very helpful to think about it as sometimes you have to let go because you know and trust that you’re going to get there eventually. If you go this other direction then you open up and prepare to finally get to where you were trying go before.</span></p>
<p class="western"><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Diego: Yeah, sometimes it’s just that the mind gets tired of trying to break through a problem.</span></em></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Andrew: That’s true.</span></p>

<p>Books like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Peoples-Temple-Black-Religion-America/dp/0253216559" target="_blank">Peoples Temple and Black Religion in America</a>, Cheryl Sanders&#8217;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Saints-Exile-Holiness-Pentecostal-Experience-American/dp/0195131010" target="_blank"> Saints in Exile</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Books-American-Negro-Spirituals/dp/0306812029" target="_blank">James and Rosamond Johnson&#8217;s books of spirituals were highly relevant to the work we discussed in the interview</a>.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=john+cage" target="_blank">And anything by John Cage</a>.  <a href="http://www.rumi.org.uk/poetry/" target="_blank">Rumi has been a bit of an influence </a>for me as well, or at least an inspiration. <a href="http://www.coldbacon.com/writing/borges-garden.html" target="_blank"> Borges fits in there too, although I haven&#8217;t read a lot.</a></p>
<p>[Artists]</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure I have individual artists to name, but the quilting/patchwork aesthetic, both from Africa and the diaspora is important to me.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/African-quilting.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-248" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/African-quilting-300x188.jpg" alt="African quilting" width="300" height="188" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/African-quilting-300x188.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/African-quilting-153x96.jpg 153w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/African-quilting.jpg 912w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>[Ideas]</p>
<p>There are so many!  I think most of them fall under the category of &#8220;theology.&#8221; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_theology" target="_blank"> My favorites are theologies of &#8220;liberation,&#8221; or anything that articulates the faith of the oppressed or people on the margins. </a> Christian and African American or European American theologies are the most familiar to me, but that does not mean I find them any more &#8220;correct&#8221; than less familiar theologies.  Buddhist thought is another influence.</p>

<h2 id="profile">[Profile]</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fernando is an unusual member of the creative music community in the Bay Area. Being not a musician, but an avid music fan andrecord collector, he started <a href="https://www.facebook.com/vampmusicandart?fref=ts" target="_blank">VAMP, his record shop, in the early 90’s and out of his love for music, he began arranging weekly soul, jazz and trip-hop concerts at the back of his shop.</a> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He says about VAMP and<a href="/interviews/john-lee-bay-improviser-music-scene-calendar/" target="_blank"> his introduction to the Bay Area Music Communities:</a> “I started VAMP as a need for survival,  I went  through a divorce (after ten years of marriage to Holly Schneider</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; percussionist &amp; founder of <a href="http://studiograndoakland.org/" target="_blank">Studio Grand</a>) and was paying quite a bit of child support (more than 1/2 my paycheck was garnished) so I was forced to sell my Art &amp; Record Collection.. an activity which soon turned into VAMP&#8230; Through Vamp I met so many amazing people (artists, musicians and people who love culture) and as a result is I started putting underground concerts in the back of my shop.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a while he went into a 10+ year hiatus from booking shows until he was “asked by the The Chuckleberry&#8217;s (local garage rock group) to do a special day show in rear space of the old VAMP (in Cleveland Heights). A touring group from LA, &#8220;The Sidewalk Society&#8221; played that time as well&#8230; It was a very loud show but my space held up to the sound, for most of the space was literally below ground, which worked great for insulating the sound&#8230; you could hardly heard from the outside. I figured if I could put on a loud show with a group like The Sidewalk Society I could do anything and get away with it&#8230; so I started putting on concerts again&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after that concert he became involved with the experimental music scene of the Bay Area by founding the Oakland Freedom Jazz Society (a Monday series) at <a href="http://www.oaklandlayover.com/" target="_blank">The Layover Bar in downtown Oakland</a>. It was based on a challenge by owner Tim Martinez &amp; manager Dennis Yadroff, for Mondays were the bar’s worst night of the week. “They were &#8220;open-minded&#8221; musically to give me a chance to showcase experimental &amp; avant-jazz musicians, being that most venues would only catered to acts which draw an audience” by contrast to “most stage managers/booking agents who in a very conservative attitude do not care about the music but <img class="alignright wp-image-227" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/10391450_760151664006306_7157593473847854175_n.jpg" alt="Oakland Freedom Jazz Society featuring Lisa Mezzacappa" width="268" height="442" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/10391450_760151664006306_7157593473847854175_n.jpg 582w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/10391450_760151664006306_7157593473847854175_n-182x300.jpg 182w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/10391450_760151664006306_7157593473847854175_n-58x96.jpg 58w" sizes="(max-width: 268px) 100vw, 268px" />only about sales”. He then came across five artists from the local scene to whom he gave long term residency. The early band-leaders involved were <a href="http://www.aramshelton.com/" target="_blank">Aram Shelton</a>,<br />
<a href="http://www.lisamezzacappa.com/" target="_blank">Lisa Mezzacappa</a>, <a href="http://vijayanderson.com/" target="_blank">Vijay Anderson</a>, <a href="http://www.bengoldberg.net/" target="_blank">Ben Goldberg</a> and <a href="http://darrenjohnstonmusic.com/" target="_blank">Darren Johnston</a>. He found them to be, not only as professional as any other musician, but even more theatrical and interesting than their more traditional counterparts. Plus they were also willing to play the gig out of love for the music rather than for the love of money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a while, the series evolved and location changes were due, the series relocated first to <a href="http://www.duendeoakland.com/" target="_blank">Duende, a &#8220;Spanish-inspired restaurant&#8221; </a>, then to<br />
<a href="http://www.spicemonkeyrestaurant.com/" target="_blank">Spice Monkey a globally inspired restaurant</a> located in 1628 Webster, in Oakland, CA, and finally to <a href="http://studiograndoakland.org/" target="_blank">Studio Grand, a &#8220;a nonprofit multi-use storefront</a> that supports local families, youth, emerging and established artists by hosting a mix of music, performance, educational, visual art classes and events.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the Oakland Freedom Jazz Society series at Studio Grand,  Fernando curates hosts the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/vampmusicandart?fref=ts" target="_blank">Live@VAMP music series (curated by Mars De Pop) </a>and helps bring awareness to the recently opened <a href="https://oaklandoctopus.org/" target="_blank">Octopus Literary Salon</a>, a cafe, bookstore and intimate performance space. He also curates the visual art shows at VAMP which occur every 2nd Saturdays, and which he takes effort on making more festive by bringing in local musicians from anywhere between the experimental to pop music communities, often pairing them in creative ways that increase their exposure to diverse audiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the following mini-interview Fernando tells us about the challenges and benefits of booking experimental music on restaurants, cafes and shops, all of which have a somewhat more commercial orientation.</span></p>

<h2 id="challenges">[Challenges, benefits and advantages of booking music for restaurants, bars or cafes]</h2>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: The Spice Monkey, Duende and Octopus Literary Salon, are all either restaurants, bars or cafes. Which are the challenges, benefits and advantages of booking music for this kinds of venues?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fernando: <strong>The Challenges</strong> in running a experimental/avant-jazz series in a restaurent/bar from my experience wa<strong>s more noise levels than anything plus your occasional high frequency&#8217;s which can be abrasive</strong> to a few who just want to enjoy a quit dinner. The spaces(restaurants) mentioned above all approached me to do some love musical entertainment. (you can say owning a records shop gave me some clout in town).  To go back to &#8220;the challenges&#8221;  .. <strong>I always worry that an ensemble or musicians would be too loud</strong> &#8230; I cross my fingers. For the most part 90% of all my concerts go off with out a hitch, but there were couple artists who were way to loud&#8230; that I received complaints.  Since then<strong> I chose to move away from the restaurant &#8220;as a stage&#8221; , the main reason is that most restaurants close too early&#8230;. and i find in Oakland/New York/LA that folks go out on the later side to see music 9/10pm.</strong> Where as my current residency at Spice Monkey closes at 10pm. I found it too stressful to showcase 2-3 groups in a 2 hour time frame. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The Benefits</strong>: folks were able to enjoy a drink(cocktail) or dinner while being entertainment. <strong>I believe Free-Jazz can be Dinner-Jazz and not be watered down as background music. Followers of the series appreciated being able to sip on a cocktail while watching a solo,</strong> though some employees may not be so open minded. I chose Duende and Spice Monkey for they were housed in two of my favorite buildings in Oakland. <strong>I believe the a great designed interior makes for a even better experience, </strong>and can make the night memorable.  Another benefit was that<strong> I was able to offer musicians free drinks and deals on meals.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m currently looking forward to our future home at<a href="http://studiograndoakland.org/" target="_blank"> Studio Grand</a>: pure music &amp; no food, but drinks are available. </span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: Which types of creative/experimental/etc. music are best fitting for these types of venues?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fernando: I found acoustic <strong>music using traditional instruments was well suited for these space</strong> (less jarring) offering less amplification.  To me it&#8217;s important to make an effort to offer different types of arrangements/instruments. I&#8217;m still looking for that perfect place, one that is elegant and that we can be loud-as-hell in.  (I hope to own such a space someday).</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: What characterizes the restaurants or bars that are open and willing to host an experimental music series?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fernando: Both Duende &amp; Spice Monkey offered artful dishes (Duende &#8211; Spanish food) (Spice Monkey &#8211; Asian Fusion). Both places struggled on Mondays both reached out to bring more paying customers. Both had Head of Operations that trusted my taste in music and network of people.</span></p>
<h2 id="proposing-series-restaurant-bar">[Taking experimental music to a venue such as a restaurant or a bar]</h2>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: If someone wanted to approach a similar venue, what would you recommend them to do in order to get them to agree to host a series like yours?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fernando: I would write a proposal stating as clear as possible your intent with the series, listing the composers, band leaders and musicians who played in my series. You need to be confident that you will draw a crowd, a crowd that will also buy a drink or dinner. <strong>I let them know that what I&#8217;m presenting is more &#8220;art&#8221; than &#8220;pop-music&#8221;, that the audience may hate or love it (like art)</strong> and that you may not be able to &#8220;tap a toe to the music&#8221;  (it&#8217;s head music not dance music). Its a bit of risk hosting a avant-jazz/noise show in a popular restaurant, especially if you don&#8217;t know the owner (which I was fortunate to know the owners of all the spaces I hosted music at). I also let them know that the musicians I work with are very professional.  </span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: What benefits can such venues expect from hosting such a series?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fernando: <strong>They will expect a cool crowd who have some money to spend at the restaurant, free music with no-hassle set up.</strong> I also let spaces (restaurants) know that there are only a few places left (in the Bay Area) which host free-jazz/experimental music. <strong>That will make there restaurant cool in the eyes of musicians.</strong></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: What are the essential points of the agreement? (Payment for the musicians, percentage for the venue, etc.)</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fernando: Each venue was different in regards to agreements. The Layover Bar: paid $100 flat to me to distribute to all the musicians, that is a generous guarantee for a bar. We did not charge a cover at the door.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Duende: gave us 100% of the door, to help build up the music presence there. With new management it change to 70/30 split, 70% going to the artist. Free Drink Ticket for each musician. Spice Monkey: gave 100% of the door to the musicians plus 1 drink ticket for each musician.  And now with Studio Grand I was able to secure 80/20 split of the door. I currently receive $0 for my work running/booking the series (it&#8217;s my giving back).</span></p>
<h2 id="curating-philosophy">[Curating Philosophy]</h2>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: How do you decide on the bands or ensembles that are playing on a particular night?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fernando: I try and to offer some variety when curating the series,<strong> I like opposites</strong>: acoustic vs electric, soloist vs large ensembles, veteran vs beginner, instrumentation: strings vs reeds , brass or percussive or electronics, or two groups using the same instruments but in widely different ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I check out a lot of sound clips of composers requesting to play.  <strong>I rarely turn down an artist but find a suitable venue for their talent.</strong> However I never have enough time to hear everything an artist puts out, I get a taste to get an idea of their sound and try to pair them with another group that is opposite. I don&#8217;t know music theory so I&#8217;m not looking at compositions in details, <strong>I go with my gut.</strong> Sometimes <strong>I ask groups to help find a supporting group to share the bill.</strong> <strong>I keep a master calendar (a word doc) with dates booked out for 2-3months.</strong></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: How does the booking differ from working with Studio Grand, or on your own shop Vamp?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fernando: I use the same approach when booking at my shop, VAMP or at Studio Grand. I use VAMP to showcase new composers, more experimental music (noise) or if someone is traveling through town and needs a last minute space to perform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tend to reserve Studio Grand for more acoustic shows, larger avant-jazz ensembles. Groups with a larger following (like<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2WSeZZV6iQ" target="_blank"> Fred Frith</a>) plus groups which need a acoustic piano or quiet room.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego: How would you describe your mission as a curator?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1">Fernando: My mission with my weekly music series is plain and simple: provide a space for musicians to take chances, try new material while providing a positive environment where it is ok to make mistakes (i.e. fall on your face).</p>

<p><span id="introduction">This is the second part of the interview I had with musician, composer, curator and record producer Rent Romus. For over 24 years he has been running Edgetone Records, one of the most representative record labels in the Bay Area creative music scene. Here he talks about the principles behind Edgetone Records, the obstacles his and other independent record labels encounter, the relationship between record sales and live performance, and the philosophy that has allowed him to do what he loves and to be happy and satisfied with his career.</span></p>

<p><b></b><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Diego Villaseñor: </b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Could we talk about how different record labels can fit into an experimental music scene like the Bay Area&#8217;s?</span></span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Rent Romus:</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> Well there are a lot of different models in the creative music scene. A lot of them are independent and run by artists. They usually develop out of a basic need to self-publish either because we can’t find anyone to pick up our music or distribute the music, or because we don’t fit within the normal construct of commercialism. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I think that that’s one of the major forces behind all independent record labels and that’s why the majority of the labels in the creative music scene, with a few exceptions such as<a href="http://www.tzadik.com/" target="_blank"> Tzadik [John Zorn&#8217;s record label]</a>, are relatively small. There was a label called Elektra Nonesuch, which held musicians like Tom Waits (who’s actually an improviser), he’s part of our community he lives here [San Francisco Bay Area], I have records of him improvising out in the woods in the 70s. <a href="http://www.discogs.com/label/652-Nonesuch" target="_blank">Elektra Nonesuch came along as an experiment with major distribution and world distribution to help musicians like Waits, Laurie Anderson, and Zorn (before he ever started Tzadik).</a></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In general though. </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>it’s just a vehicle, and an administrative process to make the music available to the general public as well as a documentation purposes too.</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> It’s not like we’re going to make a whole bunch of money. Hell, if we’re lucky we don’t lose money on our label [laughs]. Which for the first ten years I did. <a href="http://edgetonerecords.com/information.html" target="_blank">But I’ve been able to just about break even since I changed the model up for Edgetone Records.</a></span></span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Also I think the one importance left in being on a label these days is you get to use the identity, which offers a certain amount of support and belonging, like that of a sub-community within the larger community. It also helps with radio play, and with promotion. Although things have changed in the last 15 years or so. </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Since the early millennia, the need for a label has become less and less important in my opinion</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">. I see this as someone who supports a DIY mindset and actively encourage everyone just to press their own records and/or distribute their own music, especially because of all the services that are out there. So, “do we need labels anymore?” Probably not. </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>From my perspective labels don’t really legitimize you anymore as a musician like the myth tells us. It’s more about what you do personally to get out there and make your music available.</b></span></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Diego:</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> So the main difference between, pressing your own records or being on a label is that the label will help you connect with other influencers around the world?</span></span></em></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Rent:</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> Usually labels have developed something of that, or at least the name itself carries some weight when you send the music out for reviews and to radio, or to film and another outlets. You have that name which likely has its own history.</span></span> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">However, my label is probably a little more proactive than others but very much in line process wise. I would place </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Edgetone somewhere between a standard label and an independent DIY. When I pick up an album I’ll actually send it out on my end and do the promotions.</b></span></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Diego:</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> And does the selection of musicians imply a certain kind of added value? How do you select artists for your label? Does that also gives value to the label as whole?</span></span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Rent</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">: That’s true, yeah. I mean, it depends on the label. </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>My label is a bit more egalitarian in terms of offering a wide selection of music. Edgetone Records it’s not all about pure free improv, you know, I have a lot of jazz record on there, punk albums, free metal, even experimental hip-hop, which is pretty cool and stuff and few quirky odd retro indie,</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> weird but definitely pop of yore. <a href="/interviews/rent-romus-on-the-san-franciscos-bay-area-experimental-music-scene-and-curating-a-music-series/">So I like to take a wide variety. </a></span></span><a href="/interviews/rent-romus-on-the-san-franciscos-bay-area-experimental-music-scene-and-curating-a-music-series/" target="_blank"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>It’s similar to how I book for series too, I pretty much apply my philosophy across the broad, what we talked about before: cross-pollination.</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> The label kind of reflects it, it&#8217;s like a small version of the larger community in a sense.</span></span></a></p>
<p><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Diego:</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> How do you emphasize this cross-pollination between artists within your label?</span></span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Rent</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">: Well, you know that’s an interesting question. Promotionally it’s rather difficult, but the one thing that glues all my catalogue together, is college radio, because most of college radio doesn’t care about genre as much as commercial radio or NPR. College radio is all over the place, similarly to Edgetone. </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>I think college radio has played an integral and very important in giving legitimacy to what I’m trying to do at Edgetone. </b></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">On the other side cross-pollination also occurs inside the label, because the catalogue is very wide and has a pretty big spectrum of sounds, some musicians on the label, who are more proactive, have taken a look at the rest of the catalogue and discovered other musicians they didn’t know about and reached out musically. There is clear influence there, too, but I think most happens because of live curation which is still pretty much the life&#8217;s blood of what we’re doing here in this area. It’s that live interaction, community growth and development&#8230; involvement, things like that. The label is a vehicle, it’s a bucket that helps document what’s happening at the moment. And oddly enough I’ve recently realized we are coming up on our 25</span></span><sup><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">th</span></span></sup><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> year, next year, for the label.</span></span></p>

<h2 id="documentation">[How a record label gives visibility to a scene]</h2>
<p><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Diego:</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> I think it’s very interesting, this idea of having a kind of memory of the scene, which the label provides.</span></span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Rent:</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> That’s true, it does serve that function, you’re right.</span></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Diego:</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> It’s interesting to have certain perspectives about how the music and the scene have evolved.</span></span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Rent</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">: True, I never thought about it that way, but you can look at the years of releases and you can kind of see group development, musician development, you can hear it. Even myself, personally, the musicality and process of my own catalogue has shifted from pretty constructed swinging jazz to all free improv noise and then back to composition and then a little smattering of improv, so you kind of see that happening at a micro level. Certain bands have their heyday and then they fizzle out, others grow and change. Certain artists go solo and you can see how their styles develop. It’s definitely a document. </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>I think labels in new and creative music are for the most part like libraries, or document hubs, where they give an image of the scene, of what’s happening at the moment and you can come and see that progression. </b></span></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Diego</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">: That’s really important, because if there were no labels there will be almost no memory.</span></span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Rent</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">: Well there wouldn’t be as much memory. It would be word of mouth or it would be like, you know, something handed down from generation to generation. But because of the advent of CDs and digital music distribution, documentation has expanded exponentially and I think that helps in some ways people who are growing and who want to learn about, or understand what’s happening, or that know that they can play music outside the context of what they were programed to believe in</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>. </b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Because music education and the academia, whether or not I think it should catch up (which is another debate), still doesn’t really express what’s happening in the community in real time.</span></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Diego: </b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Yeah, I was just at a concert in San Francisco, an academic music concert, and I felt the same way as I feel in Mexico, there was no difference between the two places. But I haven’t felt the same way in all the other concerts of what can be properly called the scene here.</span></span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Rent:</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> Yeah right, that’s actually a real issue that I have as well. </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>W</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>hat I think labels do is catalogue and give you an idea that there’s more out there than just one way of doing things, that’s the beauty.</b></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Diego:</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> What kind of strategy do you use to promote the music of your label? How do you breach the barrier of radio, to get to the people want to get to know the artists from your label?</span></span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Rent:</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> I could say that</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b> for the most part radio and press support have become a bit more peripheral to the mass digital offerings these days in terms of how well and artist does. </b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It’s an old way of thinking from days bygone: that promotional support like radio and press alone will be the one and only way to make you more visible. </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>My sales are more linked to how proactive the artist is, so the most successful artists on my label are also the most prolific performers. </b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">There’s a direct link with live performance in terms of how successful the label sells the music and I know this because I can look at the numbers. Suppose you don’t have any music out now right, and let’s say you&#8217;ve been doing live performance, you are getting your name out there and people are knowing you, when you put your record out even if your performance level dropped you probably would be better off than somebody who didn’t perform at all and just put a record out.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I&#8217;ve seen this happen, I know this because of the three tops selling artists in my label, one is<a href="http://www.thollem.com/" target="_blank"> Thollem McDonas, pianist, he’s pretty brilliant, he’s been across the world including Mexico a few times actually</a>. He’s worked with <a href="http://www.carminaescobar.com/" target="_blank">Carmina Escobar</a> and r<a href="http://www.edgetonerecords.com/estamos.html" target="_blank">uns a group called Estamos Ensemble, a cross section between Mexican and American performers and composers</a>, he did that for about two years. Anyways, I digress; he had been perpetually performing, for seven years he was out there boom boom boom, I was sending out orders on a steady stream for most of that time. Another is <a href="http://edoctorsmith.com/" target="_blank">Eric Smith, he’s a drummer and goes by the name of E. Doctor Smith, he is and has been very prolific going all the way back to his days working with Madonna.</a> A lot of people around the world know his name. So when they see his music up on iTunes they say ‘oh I’m going to buy that’. </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>It’s that</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b> name recognition created by literally going out and performing live that makes the promotion work. </b></span></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Diego:</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> How many performances per week or month would be ideal? </span></span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Rent:</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> Well, for me the goal was always to play once a month&#8230; or else I’d go crazy.</span></span></p>

<p><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Diego: </b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">And is it possible for an artist to make a substantial income from performance and sales? </span></span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Rent:</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> It’s really tough. I mean, a lot of musicians who are making their living in music are doing more than just free improvisation and/or creative music. They are probably teaching classes either privately or for institutions, or they are involved in some other genres of music, you know, like straight ahead jazz gigs, or they’re doing corporate R &amp; B. On the other hand, there’s Thollem, who&#8217;s a good example for me as he insisted early on to doing his own music and making money out of it. And I know it was an extreme struggle. Because to do something like that you have to depend on the kindness of strangers to help you out at the beginning with places to stay, living hand to mouth. Still yet it’s very… it&#8217;s almost impossible at least in this county to make a living playing original music.</span></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Diego: </b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">John Zorn would be a case of that?</span></span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Rent:</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> Yeah, but you also have to look at it in a historical context. <a href="http://www.rowan.edu/open/philosop/clowney/Aesthetics/Zorn.htm" target="_blank">So someone like Zorn started out at a time when there were possibly more opportunities that are not around any longer.</a> In any case each time period has a set of different opportunities and different challenges. The experiment of Elektra Nonesuch may have had a positive effect on the success he and others now enjoy.</span></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Diego</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">: So the experiment somehow worked because it had a positive effect on this musicians?</span></span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b><br />
Rent:</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> Well strangely enough it worked for the individual, but the label from my understanding was considered a failure by the mainstream music industry. They did not sell the “millions of copies” [Laughs].</span></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Diego:</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> Yeah, well it worked from our perspective, not from theirs.</span></span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Rent</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">: Exactly. From our perspective those guys are monsters of music, they are legends, they are immense.</span></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Diego</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">: Maybe there&#8217;s a possibility to do what Elektra Nonsuch was doing, but in a widespread communitarian way.</span></span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Rent</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">: Well and there are some labels in the realm. Like I said Tzadik is probably sustainable. You can actually be a free improviser in other parts of the world and do a lot better than here. I am supposing, and again, I don’t have complete verification in that.</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b> It seems to me that there is a lot more appreciation for creative arts in general, in other parts of the world, than we have here.</b></span></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Diego:</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> Could you mention which spots?</span></span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Rent:</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> Well my understanding is that Western Europe is well off comparatively speaking. I can’t speak for South America, Central America or Asia. But I would think that any culture that values itself would do well. For instance</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b> South Korea</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">, there the Government officially acknowledges the value of artists, I mean for real. <a href="http://intangibleasset82.com/" target="_blank">There was this movie made by an Australian drummer [Emma Franz]. It’s called<em> Intangible Asset No. 82.</em> And intangible assets are actually people who are creative; in this case the Intangible Asset No. 82 was a Korean Shaman singer who this drummer was out looking for.</a> The whole movie is about him meeting and working with the singer.</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b> It is great to see that a democratic elected Government looks at performing artists and its own people as intangible assets for the culture.</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> Whereas here it is not about that; it’s about how much money you got. “Artist! What the hell is that? Why don’t you get a job?” It’s true you know.</span></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Diego:</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> That’s a hobby.</span></span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Rent:</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> “You’re playing instrument? How quaint? Look at that.”&#8230;I always get that “Hey you still play music?”, “Ah, am I still breathing?” Yah but that’s how they devalue you in the States as a performing artist. It’s like a hobby. </span></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Diego: </b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Only if you’re a super star, but then you get a major label to support you, but then that&#8217;s is not really about the music but rather about the aura that surrounds you.</span></span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Rent:</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> Right, yeah, it’s not about art at all, it&#8217;s all an illusion. But that’s okay, you know, when I was young I believed that I could be a young lion of Jazz. Like all these players who were coming up and they were being called out by the mainstream press and stuff. I was very frustrated to find out that I couldn’t do that. </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>No matter what I did it just didn’t seemed to matter to anybody right, at least, on the industry side. “No one knows me, ahh”, so you get disillusioned and like depressed,</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> and you find a day job just to pay the bills and you’re scrapping through but then… </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>but in my case, at some point I realized that it’s not me, it’s the system.</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> Because if I wanted to go do Duke Ellenton tributes, and play like Monk or Charlie Parker, if I wanted to do that, I could probably eek out a living as a Jazz musician. So if I pretended to be someone else&#8230; but </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>I realize that I have to do what’s good for me, what’s feel good and what’s feel right, and if that means I got to work a day job and be happy I’d rather do that any day. I’ve decided just on a personal level that I wanted to be comfortable, meaning that I can put out a record whenever I want, which I kind of got to that point, it’s taken me a while but that goal is real and I can put on a show. So I am pretty happy. </b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">And I love to revel in the success of others too, that’s the beautiful part. I’m no longer playing in the jazz world that was always like, you know “oh, I don’t like that person because they’re successful”; none of that. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>That’s why I love the creative music scene, because there’s not a lot of money in it; we’re not striving for that, so we tend to be more community based. </b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">There’s more of an opportunity to play with each other, and support each other, and be happy for each other, for whatever successes each one of us brings to the table. </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>When I see press for another one of our community members I’m like “yeah!” and I want to share that, I want to tell people about it “check out so and so, they got those articles in the newspaper”, because it helps all of us.</b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> When a good review comes out, I want to share that, and the other musician&#8217;s work too. I&#8217;ll post it on my Facebook page, because reciprocal altruism exists, where I do something nice for you and maybe or maybe not, down the line, you might just do something nice for me, and we support each other that way. Is not expected because then it wouldn’t be altruistic, but at least that’s the general idea you do a good deed for others, they might in turn do good for you. </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>So that’s why I really like the music community and keep this label running.</b></span></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">This interview is aimed to be an introduction to one of the most powerful tools any music scene can have (regardless of genre).</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://bayimproviser.com/" target="_blank">BayImproviser.com</a> is a very unique calendar that serves the San Francisco Bay Area creative music scene. It has listings for almost all  the shows going around, the musicians playing in them and the venues where they play. It is <a href="/interviews/rent-romus-on-the-san-franciscos-bay-area-experimental-music-scene-and-curating-a-music-series/#bay-improviser" target="_blank">&#8220;<b>the glue&#8230; that bridges all of the different areas of exploration within the scene and a great place for artists to promote their music.&#8221;</b></a></p>
<p class="p1"> Bay Improviser was created in 1998 by John Lee (way before Facebook came into existence!). It&#8217;s purpose is manyfold. <strong>First,</strong> it allows any audience members to easily find out what&#8217;s going on, which increases awareness and attendance at the shows. <strong>Second</strong>, all musicians in the scene, regardless of their technical skills or interest in web sites, now have at least a basic bio and information about their shows. <strong>Third</strong>, musicians new to the area can easily get into the scene by checking the calendar and attending shows of interest, thus the site aids the integration of new members into the community.</p>
<p class="p1">In this interview with John Lee we talk about all the fundamentals of a calendar like this: the benefits it brings into the scene, it&#8217;s advantages over Facebook, and advice on creating, promoting and improving a calendar such as this.</p>
<p class="p1">*Note: If you happen to know about any other calendar such as this, feel free to drop a link in the comments section?</p>

<h2 id="solutions" class="p1">[The Problems That Bay Improviser Solves]</h2>
<p class="p1"><em>Diego Villaseñor: What led you to create Bay Improviser? What needs does it address?</em></p>
<p class="p1">John Lee: I created <a href="http://bayimproviser.com/" target="_blank"><span class="s1">bayimproviser.com</span></a> in 1998 for a couple of reasons.  At that time I was finding that I was missing a lot of shows due to the lack of <strong>a comprehensive calendar of events that I could count on to be updated and complete at all times.</strong>  At the same time, I was interested in learning to develop a web application from a career perspective.  So initially I created the site for my own personal use and learning experience.  Once I got into it, I realized that it could be highly useful for the musicians and fans of the music, so<strong> I expanded it beyond the calendar to include the Artist, Venue and other pages.</strong>  In 1998, there was no Facebook or blogging sites where a musician could easily set up a web presence, so my site allowed anyone to get a basic page up and running without needing to pay for it, or have a lot of technical expertise.</p>
<p class="p1"><em><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-03-at-12.35.40-AM.jpg"><br />
</a>Diego: How has the musical landscape in the Bay Area changed after launching the calendar?</em></p>
<p class="p1">John: There are more sub-genres, more venues, and more series now then when the site was launched in 1998.  In 1998, I think the scene was more dominated by &#8220;free jazz&#8221; than it is today.  There has been a significant increase in the number of weekly or monthly series.  The size of the audience is much larger, although still pretty small relative to more mainstream music.  During the last couple of years,<a href="http://centerfornewmusic.com/" target="_blank"> the Center for New Music in San Francisco has had a big impact with 4 or 5 shows a week, and bringing in musicians</a> from out of town.  The <a href="http://sfsound.org/" target="_blank">sfSound group has helped bring a lot more &#8220;new music&#8221;, &#8220;contemporary classical&#8221; music into the scene</a>.  The calendar was not the cause of these changes, but <strong>helped support the scene by making it more visible.</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><em>Diego: Why do you think the calendar worked so well for the Bay Area Scene?</em></p>
<p class="p1">John: There is a large contingent of musicians here so there are usually multiple shows in the bay area on any given night.  Given the amount of activity and the number of choices for going out, a calendar is essential.  <strong>So the most important prerequisite for success is a robust scene.  If there is a lot going on, then people will naturally discover and use a calendar site to keep up with things.</strong></p>

<h2 id="facebook" class="p1">[Shortcomings of Facebook With Respect To Bay Improviser]</h2>
<p class="p1"><em>Diego: What do you think of Facebook, and how it&#8217;s services compare to Bay Improviser?</em></p>
<p class="p1">John: I think the impact of facebook needs to be discussed.  What I&#8217;ve found in the past 5 years or so is that many musicians have turned to facebook as their primary method of promoting themselves and their shows.  This is especially true with the under 30 year old generation, who have grown up with facebook.  <strong>Personally I find facebook really inadequate for scene promotion for a variety of reasons, but it has certainly grown increasingly dominant. </strong> So anyone thinking about starting an independent site to promote a scene (experimental or otherwise) needs to question if they really want to compete with facebook, or whether they would be better off just having a page on facebook?</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Diego: Could you name the main aspects in which you find Facebook to be an inadequate platform?</em></p>
<p class="p1">John: Facebook can be used in two ways.  First, musicians can have their own pages and followers.  Second, a dedicated &#8220;scene&#8221; page can be created which includes all musicians.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>If musicians rely on their own page, then there are several limitations</strong>.<strong>  First</strong>, in order to reach the audience, the audience members must first know about you, <strong>second</strong> they have to be on Facebook, and <strong>third</strong> they have to become &#8220;friends&#8221; with you.  Someone new to the scene would not have any way to know what&#8217;s going on until they start adding friends on Facebook, and it could take months, or years, to discover folks this way.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>If a dedicated &#8220;scene&#8221; page is used, then a lot of the things my site does will not happen. </strong> For example, if a show is listed, the musicians playing in the show will not be automatically linked to the show.  And if using the &#8220;scene&#8221; page, there is no way to identify individual musicians of interest to get notified of their shows.  Also, I have been told that there is a fairly low number of people you can send event announcements to without having to pay Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Show-e1436945798198.jpeg"><img class="wp-image-169 size-large aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Show-e1436945798198-553x1024.jpeg" alt="Show Listing Page on Bay Improviser" width="553" height="1024" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Show-e1436945798198-553x1024.jpeg 553w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Show-e1436945798198-162x300.jpeg 162w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Show-e1436945798198-52x96.jpeg 52w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Show-e1436945798198.jpeg 1029w" sizes="(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px" /></a></p>
<h2 id="advice" class="p1">[Advice On Creating Similar Calendars]</h2>
<p class="p1"><em>Diego: Do you know of similar projects around the world?</em></p>
<p class="p1">John: There are a number of calendar oriented sites out there.  Frankly, I haven&#8217;t spent a lot of time researching other similar sites.  I&#8217;d be interested in knowing about them.  But based on what I&#8217;ve seen, <span class="s1"><a href="http://BayImproviser.com/" target="_blank">BayImproviser.com</a> </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">is unique in putting together not only the calendar, but the Artist, Venue and other pages.  And at bayimproviser everything is linked together.  For example,<strong> in a show listing, the Bay Improviser musicians are linked to the show and their music and videos will show up in the event listing.  So someone interested in the show can get a better idea of what to expect and can learn about the musicians.  Conversely, you can go to an Artist page and see their upcoming shows listed.</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><em>Diego: I&#8217;ve heard that other people have attempted to do a calendar like Bay Improviser, but that at times these efforts have not replicated the success of Bay Improviser. To what factors do you attribute that?</em></p>
<p class="p1">John: I think<strong> the site needs to be seen as non-biased and comprehensive. </strong><a href="http://BayImproviser.com/" target="_blank">BayImproviser.com</a><span class="s1"> </span>is certainly that.  Obviously there needs to be some boundaries established for which shows and which musicians are covered on the site, but beyond that I don&#8217;t have any editorial bias as far as what shows and musicians are listed.  With some similar sites I&#8217;ve seen over the years, there is usually some venue or smaller subset of musicians that are the focus of the site, and no attempt is made to cover the entire scene.  So I think a site that strives to cover an entire &#8220;scene&#8221; and make all shows and musicians equally visible without bias is much more useful to the audience.  Another factor is that<strong> these sites depend on having one or more folks who are willing to put in the time, week after week, year after year, to keep the listings current.</strong>  What often happens is a site will be started and then the people maintaining the listings run out of time, move away, etc. and the site gradually dies off from lack of maintenance of the listings.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Diego: What would you advice to someone trying to set up a calendar for his particular scene?</em></p>
<p class="p1">John: The first thing would be to decide to <strong>make a long term commitment to putting energy into maintaining the listings.</strong>  It&#8217;s time consuming.  I have more than 50 musician, venue and calendar sites I visit on a regular basis to discover shows that need to be posted on <a href="http://bayimproviser.com/" target="_blank"><span class="s1">BayImproviser.com</span></a>.  Also, the social aspect is super important.  The site will be more successful if the people maintaining it are also out attending the shows and getting to know the musicians and other audience members.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Diego: Is there any open source version of the code that some might recur to if they wanted to create a calendar for their scenes?</em></p>
<p class="p1">John: <a href="http://bayimproviser.com/" target="_blank"><span class="s1">BayImproviser.com</span></a> is a custom built site done by professional developers.  The original version was done entirely by me.  For the rewrite, I enlisted the help of some developers who worked for me on other projects to build out the main functionality.  I then polished it up and put in the effort to make it work well on mobile devices. When the site was first built, WordPress and other do-it-yourself site creation tools didn&#8217;t exist.  Someone doing a site like this today would want to use some site building tool.  For example, <a href="http://experimentalportland.com/" target="_blank">Experimental Portland is one I just came across when looking for similar sites.  This is done in WordPress.  </a>It&#8217;s mostly news and a calendar, but for a quick, basic site it&#8217;s fine.</p>
<h2 id="promotion" class="p1">[Promoting the Calendar]</h2>
<p class="p1"><em>Diego: Who helped (building the site, getting the word around, etc.)? What did it require to get the project launched and maintained?</em></p>
<p class="p1">John: I did all the technical work myself, and promoted the site myself at the beginning.  For the first year of the site&#8217;s existence I attended 2-3 shows per week and introduced myself to the musicians and the folks running the series and encouraged them to post their shows and info on the site.  The goal was to <strong>make the site &#8220;self-service&#8221; so it didn&#8217;t depend on me to do all the updates.  Eventually, the majority of the calendar events were posted by the musicians or folks running the venues, so my effort was reduced quite a bit.</strong>  I had help from the<a href="http://www.bayimproviser.com/artists.aspx" target="_blank"> musicians and venues who posted their events and updated their Artist pages. </a> This is a really important aspect of the site, that it is &#8220;self-service&#8221; and anyone can post shows.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Diego: How did you make other musicians aware of its existence and how did you get them to appreciate its usefulness and to use it? </em></p>
<p class="p1">John: I attended shows on a regular basis and introduced myself to the musicians.  I handed out flyers promoting the site.  Word of mouth among the musicians helped spread awareness.  I think flyers are important so people have something to stick in their pocket and pull out later when they are at home and near a computer.  In those days, you couldn&#8217;t view a web site on a mobile phone, so people needed to go home to check it out.  And the Artist pages were important.  If a musician checks out the site and sees their friends up there with a page, it motivates them to get their own page.  After the first year, some of the musicians were very proactive in promoting the site.  <a href="/interviews/rent-romus-on-the-san-franciscos-bay-area-experimental-music-scene-and-curating-a-music-series/" target="_blank">I would have to single out Rent Romus as someone who has contributed greatly to the success of the site, both by posting his shows and by recommending to musicians that they contact me </a>to get a page set up.  Many folks have mentioned that they first heard about the site from Rent.</p>
<h2 id="improvements" class="p1">[Improvements On Bay Improviser]</h2>
<p class="p1"><em>Diego: How do you think that Bay Improviser or rather, the project that it represents -coordinating and spreading the word about performances of musicians- could be improved?</em></p>
<p class="p1">John: I did a major upgrade last year, and at some point I ran out of time and money and had to get a job.  So we didn&#8217;t finish some things I wanted to do.  I need to improve the <strong>mailing list</strong>, for example.  <strong>There is not currently much social networking built in to the site, but to be honest, I don&#8217;t think <a href="http://bayimproviser.com/" target="_blank"><span class="s1">BayImproviser.com</span></a> can compete with Facebook in this area.  </strong>So from a technology and features perspective, the site is in pretty good shape.  <strong>The current dilemma is in getting the musicians to update their profiles. </strong> This would require a major effort in promotion by me, and I have not had the time to do it.  The site needs more up to date sound files, embedded videos, &#8220;favorites&#8221; lists, photos, etc.  Hopefully over time we&#8217;ll get everything updated.  <strong>I would like to have more articles, interviews, concert reviews, etc. on the site.</strong>  I plan on contacting some folks who are doing things in this area to see if they want to make their efforts part of the BayImproviser site.  So in general the non-calendar content needs more updates.  I need collaborators to help in these areas.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Diego: One of the main problems I&#8217;ve observed in the Bay Area scene is that audience members are very often musicians from within the scene, and that not enough people from outside are coming to the shows; thus the scene (to me) seems to be &#8220;sustainable&#8221;, to play with an ecological metaphor, but not growing, it is healthy and vibrant but plateaued. Do you have any ideas as to what could help it break through towards other audiences?</em></p>
<p class="p1">John: A lot of the music covered on the site is inherently non-commercial and will never achieve mass popularity.  There is definitely some room for growth, but it&#8217;s never going to appeal to a large audience.  There are some shows and musicians who are playing more mainstream (for example, having a drummer keeping time) and these could certainly appeal to a larger audience.  And <strong>in fact I&#8217;ve seen these shows getting more popular over the last couple of years.  <a href="http://www.makeoutroom.com/" target="_blank">The monthly series at the Make Out room in the Mission in San Francisco has been getting larger turnout</a>, in part because there is usually at least one act playing more accessible music. </strong> It also helps that it&#8217;s a bar in the Mission!  So people can get a drink and hang out with their friends while listening to the show.  To be clear, I&#8217;m not recommending that people consciously try to make their music more mainstream to get a larger audience.  A better strategy would be to play what they want, but<strong> be more outgoing and accessible at the shows.  This would be my main advice to musicians wanting to build a larger audience.  This is a social scene as much as a music scene, so building on the social aspect will be really helpful.</strong></p>
<h2 id="conclusion" class="p1">[Finishing Thoughts]</h2>
<p class="p1">Finally I want to mention is that <strong>the coolest thing about <a href="http://bayimproviser.com/" target="_blank"><span class="s1">BayImproviser.com</span></a> is not the site itself, but rather the community of musicians and organizers that it covers!  The amount of energy they put in and commitment these folks have to their music is truly amazing. </strong> The live music &#8220;new/experimental/avante-garde&#8221; scene here in the Bay Area is pretty extraordinary.  In terms of number of events per week, I wonder if there is a city anywhere in the world that has as much?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span id="introduction">[Introduction]</span></h2>
<p>Experimental musician, drum machine expert manipulator, creator, podcaster, blogger, and curator. Matt Davignon has been a long time member of the San Francisco Bay Area&#8217;s creative music scene. Through his drum machines, electronic processes, field recording, and samples, he is known for creating a uniquely expressive, dreamlike and psychedelic sound world which is often inspired by organic life.</p>
<p>In this interview we talk about a wide variety of topics, ranging from his creative process for albums and remixes, to how he creates his unique drum machine sound palette, to his thoughtful and illuminating ideas on aesthetics, improvisation, and curation. All in all a very complete interview with one of the most active and involved members of the Bay Area&#8217;s experimental music community.</p>

<h2><span id="creative-process">[Creative process]</span></h2>
<p>Diego Villaseñor: Your recordings have a very strong focus on a single idea, for example, &#8220;The 3am music&#8221; revolves around the theme of sleep and &#8220;Living Things&#8221; focuses on sounds reminiscent or inspired by organic forms of life. Also, both of them inhabit very different sonic worlds. What is your starting point when you decide to work on a new album? How do you proceed afterwards? Can you talk about your process in general terms?</p>
<p>Matt Davignon:  <b>Most of the albums I do come out as a result of having a lot of recordings from live shows and practices at home. I have a process where I pick out things that sound like songs, and I&#8217;ll listen to them occasionally over the period of several months. After a period of time, I&#8217;ll have a few hours of different songs, and I&#8217;ll start to get a sense of the album theme around them</b>. Organic life is one of my favorite themes. A lot of my stuff has that inspiration. &#8220;The 3am Music&#8221; was originally going to be two different albums &#8211; a quiet drone-based one and one inspired by old mechanical equipment left in sheds.</p>
<p>The Oa project already had a theme in how the music was made, so when compiling that CD we simply picked songs that we thought played well together.</p>
<figure id="attachment_98" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/10527430_10152149554830544_8333189173290903386_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-98" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/10527430_10152149554830544_8333189173290903386_n-300x225.jpg" alt="Oa at the Luggage Store Gallery" width="300" height="225" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/10527430_10152149554830544_8333189173290903386_n-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/10527430_10152149554830544_8333189173290903386_n-128x96.jpg 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/10527430_10152149554830544_8333189173290903386_n.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Oa at the Luggage Store Gallery</figcaption></figure>
<p>We actually left a song out because it pointed towards a theme that we didn&#8217;t want to have.</p>
<p>I have a CD coming out later this year called &#8220;Pink Earth&#8221;. In that case I was getting ready for a performance at the annual Garden of Memory event at the Chapel of the Chimes. My practice sessions and live recordings revolved around the theme of reverence for a place of faith and respect for the people who are interred there. Over the following months, the recordings kept the theme of reverence, but started to develop a theme of exploring a strange new natural environment.</p>
<p>Diego: So could it be said that you have two different approaches? One in which you go from a collection of materials upon which you set to discover a theme, and then you proceed to organize, modify or create sounds around it. And then another in which you start from a theme and the proceed to make music directly related to it. Is that so?</p>
<p>Matt: Much more frequently it’s the first approach, where I discover a theme in my existing recordings, then proceed, modify and create sounds (new recordings) around it. <b>I’ve learned that if I try to develop the theme too concretely as the first step, then it doesn’t feel as natural to try to shoehorn a lot of my musical output into that theme.</b></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span id="aesthetics">[Aesthetics: Sound Sources And Sound Design]</span></h2>
<p>Diego: What role does the sound sources play in relation to the theme?</p>
<p>Matt: That’s a tricky one. To me, sound sources play a big role in my identity as a musician, but not necessarily to the theme. It’s not terribly important to me that “Living Things” and <a href="https://mattdavignon.bandcamp.com/album/the-3am-music" target="_blank">“The 3am Music” were made with 100% drum machine</a>. On the other hand, it becomes intrinsic to the non-stated themes of the record. <b>A drum machine processed to sound like a cello or an ant colony doesn’t quite sound like either a drum machine, a cello, or an ant colony. I think that in-between-ness becomes its own theme.</b></p>
<p>With “Pink Earth”, I’m using voice on a solo album for the first time. I’m not sure if the voice becomes a theme until you do something specific with it. On this album, you’ll hear sounds that are immediately recognizable as vocalization, but the changes in pitch, timbre and dynamics aren’t always following the patterns made by a human throat. I imagine that some absent part of the brain wonders, “What animal did that come from?” <b>I find this synthesis between familiar and non-familiar elements to be a fascinating world to play in.</b></p>
<p>Diego: In a way you seem to work on extending the common notions (yours and possibly the listener´s) about certain objects: living things, insomnia, the voice or a drum machine. Then they become something else than what they were supposed to be.  How did you arrive to this fascination (or in other words what do you think prompted you to conceive your music making in such a way)?</p>
<p>Matt: I do love changing the expected properties of sounds to allow for possibilities. For me personally,<b> it’s about discovering a range of possibilities that isn’t commonly explored on an instrument.</b> A piano has the very expected sound of a mallet hitting a string, with a certain attack and decay pattern. There are tens of thousands of pianists playing with just that sound. There’s a lot of variety, but it’s well-explored in most genres. “Prepared” pianists have found acoustic means of giving pianos a wider range of expression. While there is a decent number of prepared pianists, they still make up a small percentage of pianists, so to me they seem to have a lot more freedom to find something new.</p>
<p>Electronic processing and sampling technology has evolved in leaps and bounds over the last 20 years. It’s opened up paths for musicians to take instruments and sounds out of their previously-understood contexts, and to create new things that have to be heard to be imagined.</p>
<p>When I started playing drum machine, my intention wasn’t necessarily to redefine how people thought of drum machines. Ikue Mori already legitimized the drum machine as an improvisation and performance instrument long before me. I was looking for an instrument that I could play with one hand, so my remaining hand and two feet could be used to modify the sounds. The idea that I could tune a drum machine chromatically to play melodies made it even more appealing. <b>The combination between drum machine and processing devices was wonderfully responsive to the directions where I wanted to take sounds &#8211; I could change pitch and volume like traditional instruments, but I could also make sounds more porous, deep, delicate, swarming, layered, etc, and move back and forth between all these properties as easily as I could change notes. It allowed me to discover who I am musically, in a way that I couldn’t personally find with more traditional instruments.</b></p>
<p>Diego: Is that why you said that sound sources play an important role in your identity as a musician?</p>
<p>Matt: Hmmm, maybe it’s more accurate for me to say it’s the treatment of sound sources. Before drum machine, when people asked what instrument I played, I responded that I modify sounds.</p>
<p>Diego: That’s a very good answer. <a href="http://music.arts.uci.edu/dobrian/CMC2009/Liberation.pdf" target="_blank">It reminds me of Varèse calling himself a<img class="  wp-image-100 alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/72525_466816983248_4527002_n-300x225.jpg" alt="72525_466816983248_4527002_n" width="425" height="319" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/72525_466816983248_4527002_n-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/72525_466816983248_4527002_n-128x96.jpg 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/72525_466816983248_4527002_n.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" /> &#8220;a worker in rhythms, frequencies, and intensities.” </a>Now, you mention on your site that field recordings are an important source of inspiration, can you tell me about it?</p>
<p>Matt: Field recordings were one of my instruments between 2000 and 2003. I would collect them on a little cassette recorder, and for a live show, I’d manipulate 4 of these small tape machines in real time. There were no effects at all &#8211; just playing tape and doing the things you can do with tape.</p>
<p>That got me thinking about all the things that happen in a note if you think of a note as a single musical gesture. <b>On most musical instruments, a note is fairly simple: a single attack-sustain-decay-release (ASDR) pattern and a recognizable pitch. With field recordings, a single gesture could have all sorts of different events in it.</b> Even if your recording is of something simple like a church bell, you probably have environmental artifacts in your sound: birds, wind, people, etc. I was also fascinated by the linearity of it. If you draw how a simple piano note sounds out, you’ll get something like a simple water wave shape. If you draw out the peaks and valleys of a few seconds of field recording, it looks more like the horizon of a landscape or cityscape.</p>
<p>As I moved away from field recordings, I wanted the option to keep that richness in sounds, while gaining the ability to play more melodically. On one hand, I started using a volume pedal or various effects to give more complex or unpredictable ASDR shapes. I also started playing in a way that imitates natural sound elements &#8211; single events and pitched or non-pitched clusters that appear irregularly over a . <a href="https://mattdavignon.bandcamp.com/album/living-things" target="_blank">You’ll hear this in the tracks “Freshwater Hydra” and “Blind Cave Tetra” on “Living Things”</a>, and quite a bit of “The 3am Music”.</p>
<p>Diego: So in a sense, your way of listening and of understanding sound events was transformed by listening closely to field recordings, right? <strong>No longer a note or a sound event was a single clean human-made sound but rather, the complex conjunction of a diversity of sound sources. And then the stringing of ordinary notes in a melody was substituted by the stringing of more complex events, like a fusion between melodic construcción and soundscapes: ordinary human tones-music in conjunction with the way in which environments sound.</strong> Am I on the right track?</p>
<p>Matt: Yes, hopefully if I’m doing it right, that’s what it sound like.</p>
<p>Diego: Are there any other sources of inspiration that have helped shape your sonic world (in a similar way as soundscapes did)?</p>
<p>Matt: A few other things.<b> I often want my music to represent a sort of coherent unpredictability that is inspired by organic life. </b></p>
<p>Another one comes from equipment. The first live looping devices I used did not let you set start and end points to your samples, so the loops would have weird hiccups in the. Instead of 4/4, they’d often be something like 5.23. <b>I came to like that, and started trying to work rhythmic imperfections into music sometimes. </b></p>
<p>Lastly and most obviously are the musical inspirations. Since I was a teenager, I was taken with musicians who established instantly-recognizable sound identities for themselves on their instruments. Adrian Belew and Jon Hassell are good examples. I also really enjoyed the work of Klaus Schulze, who was able to do well-layered live electronic music in the 70’s from his bank of synths, organs and tape machines. <b>Coil and Nine Inch Nails were also influences for the way that they created unusual sounds in musical contexts.</b></p>

<p>Matt: I made a video a few years ago about my drum machine rig: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ELCrrMdphk" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ELCrrMdphk</a></p>
<p>It’s still about 85% accurate.</p>
<p>My current solo rig is for drum machine and voice.</p>
<p>The voice samples are pre-recorded to USB on a Numark NDX-400 digital turntable. The singing samples are of me singing a single note, looped so that it goes on continuously for about 2-3 minutes. All the pitch changes come from me using the turntable.</p>
<p>On the drum machine, I mostly use either kits where the same sound is tuned chromatically across all the pads, or the sounds on the pads have a similar nature (such as cowbells, tablas &amp; woodblocks with short decays).</p>
<p>Both the turntable and the drum machine go through a series of fx devices:</p>
<p>&#8211;Boss Dr. Sample SP-303 (mostly used for pitch bending or filtering. Very rarely for actual sampling.)</p>
<p>&#8211;Digitech DF-7 Distortion Factory (for distortion/fuzz)</p>
<p>&#8211;Electro-Harmonix Micro-Synthesizer (for more distortion and some filtering)</p>
<p>&#8211;Alesis Philtre (for hi-pass or lo-pass filtering)</p>
<p>&#8211;Alesis Amplitron (for dual tremolo effects)</p>
<p>&#8211;Volume Pedal</p>
<p>&#8211;Electro-Harmonix Super-Ego (This makes an instant drone from anything it hears)</p>
<p>&#8211;Alesis Ineko (usually used for reverb)</p>
<p>&#8211;Two DOD-DFX94 digital delay pedals</p>

<p>After that, I split it up into A and B chains for looping. One chain goes to Looperlative LP-2 looping pedal. The other goes to an Electro-Harmonix Memory Man with Hazarai. The outputs of these then go to a mixer, where I can control the volumes separately.</p>
<p>When playing with Oa, I take out the drum machine and the Super-Ego, and replace it with a Korg Micro-Sampler. The sampler is pre-loaded with a few banks of different people speaking various fragments of words. Also in Oa, I use a wider array of samples on the digital turntable, which feature multiple people speaking or singing.</p>

<h2><span id="remixing">[Remixing Experimental Music]</span></h2>
<p>Diego: It&#8217;s interesting to see that <b>you are using some of the main tools of the remix culture and somehow doing something completely different: instead of mixing elements of different styles of music you are mixing heterogeneous elements from the sound world, voices, environments, animal behaviors, musical instruments and machine &#8220;malfunctions&#8221;, etc. I think it speaks very powerfully about the power of both these tools and the core idea of remix. </b>You recently released a record with remixes of your own music by other artists and even yourself. How did the idea of such and album came about? And how did it enriched or modified the way in which you relate to the whole experience and culture of remixing?</p>
<p>Matt: I’ve always been interested in the act of remixing since I started working with CDs as source material in the mid 90s. My first remixes were for a compilation CD called “CT Project West Coast”. In 2003, <a href="https://mattdavignon.bandcamp.com/album/charcoal-ep" target="_blank">I also released an EP called “Charcoal”, which is technically 5 tracks of me remixing my first CD “5 Spots”</a>. Currently, “Charcoal” is still available, but “5 Spots” is not.</p>
<p>I’ve also done remixes for German artist Michael Peters and the experimental Christian hip-hop group Soul Junk.</p>
<p>I had never thought of doing a project of other people remixing my work until it was repeatedly suggested by my friend<a href="http://www.edgetonerecords.com/grabmiller.html" target="_blank"> Lance Grabmiller</a>.  Up until that point, I didn’t think others would be interested in remixing my work. After putting out a couple feelers on Facebook, I found the interest was there and it came together rather smoothly. I was very happy with the results, <b>I love the community aspect of it: artists sharing their musical impressions and responses to another artist’s work. I wish that more experimental artists did remix albums so that I could contribute to a few. </b></p>
<p>Diego: That&#8217;s certainly a very good idea. How do you approach the remix project?</p>
<p>Matt: As a remixer, my goal is to create something new that sounds both like the original artist, and like me. (Sounds like what every remixer does, right?) <b>I almost always use only material from the original artist, but I frequently use elements from several different songs in the same remix. </b></p>
<p>Other than that, <b>my approach</b> <b>is this</b>:</p>
<p>I’ll put the CD (or digital file) in the player, and play around with making simple loops at various speeds until I get something that I feel I can build on. Usually I stick to fairly pure notes and gestures. I’ll record that loop into my digital audio workstation for a few minutes, sometimes with a little manipulation so it doesn’t feel so repetitive. Then I’ll go back add more layers of different samples of the source material. These may be digital turntable again, or keyboard sampler or sometimes I’ll even transfer some sounds to cassette for tape manipulation. I like to treat the samples as instruments that can be played. Before my old-school CD player died, I liked to try to use the CD skipping/search function to add rhythmic elements. The whole process is very improvisational, except I can throw away things that aren’t working. After several passes, I’ll go back and mix the levels to structure it into something with a beginning, middle and end. There should be a name for this process &#8211; maybe I just don’t know what it is. How about <b>multi-track improvisation</b>?</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span id="daws">[Tips For Working With DAWs, And Improvising Over Pre-recorded Material]</span></h2>
<p>Diego: I have always struggled with improvising over prerecorded material, especially when it is also improvised,  I am intrigued, how do you make it work? Do you also do that when working for music that is not a remix?</p>
<p>Matt: I sometimes struggle with it too. So far with this strategy, the original track is either a loop of some sort, or has a loosely live-played repeating theme. The improvised stuff on top isn’t as free as solo improv. I play over the track a couple of times before I try to actually record it. I rarely keep the first take. However, I try to keep it on the loose side, and avoid getting into any kind of locked in groove.</p>
<p>It’s been a long time since I’ve done any <b>multi-tracked music</b> that wasn’t a remix. With the exception of a collaboration I did with <a href="https://rafter.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Rafter Roberts</a>, none of it has ever been released on anything official. <b>When I first started, it was my main method of music making. Then, about the time I discovered the SF free-improvisation scene, I also made the transition from 4-track cassette to digital recording via computer. While the results were much cleaner, it now took me much longer to finish a song. And I was much happier with the stuff that was free-improvised.</b> I plan to devote more time to digital multi-track recording for future projects, but I think the secret to getting it to work for me is learning to be more informal with it. To treat it more like a 4-track.</p>
<p>Diego: Do you mean, because of the limitations of 4-track recording?</p>
<p>Matt: In a way. When I transitioned to a <b>digital workstation (DAW)</b>, it came with all these tools you can use to clean up the audio. You can easily edit out mistakes, or remove any tape/room/line noise, or compress to get the levels louder. In order to save on hard drive space, it’s tempting to record loops and copy/paste the loops into compositions. It’s tempting to use all of these bells and whistles, but I found myself doing more of this track admin work than actually recording music. After years of leaving it alone, <b>I’m recently discovering I can be more productive if I record a track, adjust volume levels, then go back and do the second track, etc.. Don’t worry about polishing it up until all the tracks are done.</b></p>
<p>Diego: It seems that the more tools one has at his disposal, the more at risk one is at doing nothing but admin work.  What tools do you normally use and which ones do you prefer to avoid?</p>
<p>Matt: That’s certainly the way it works for me. <b>When doing remix work or new work, the only computer stuff I do is multi tracking, noise reduction, compression, and volume envelopes.</b> Even with my CDs being mostly based on live work, I’ve used quite a bit of editing on the last two to keep long tracks from dragging on too long.</p>
<p>Most people I know who use DAWs for composition really thrive with them. I do not. <b>I like to dial up effects in real time to find the exact right setting. I haven’t figured out how to do that in my DAW, and admittedly it hasn’t been a big priority. So most of my sound design happens before the sounds get into the computer.</b></p>
<p>Diego: What other processes or ways of doing things have you found that help you concentrate better in the creative aspects of your work and efficient?</p>
<p>Matt:<b> A big thing for me is to remove technological obstacles to taking sounds in whatever direction I might want to take them in improvisation.</b> <b>I’d have real-time controls for a set number of parameters,</b> than need to hunt through menus and lists to be able to control a larger number of parameters. <b>Most of my pedals do one specific effect very well, such as filtering.</b></p>

<p>Diego: Did your encounter with the Bay Area’s free-improvisation scene change your way of making music? If so, how?</p>
<p>Matt: Absolutely. Before I moved to SF in 1997, my only experience with the local music scene was a radio show featuring post-industrial music on KPFA (called “No Other Radio Network”, hosted at the time by John Gullak.) <b>When I started going to shows, the majority of the musicians I encountered were doing “non-idiomatic improvisation”. I had fun with that too, and it taught me to be more flexible. </b>At first my live instruments were either found objects, or a combination of turntable, CD and cassette instruments. <b>Working with other musicians got me thinking about the roles different instruments fulfill. In time, I wanted to move away from always being only the source of weird electronic sound in a group. I wanted to have a role that could contribute melodically and rhythmically to a band, without distracting from the tone and intensity of the other musicians. That’s a big part of the process that led me to drum machine. </b></p>
<p><b>The other big change was realizing that I’m a small fish in a very big pond. Meeting lots of people in the community doing very diverse work was at the same time humbling, encouraging and freeing.</b> Humbling because I was meeting lots of people who were way more creative and talented than me. Encouraging because a number of people really liked what I was doing, when I had no idea whether my work would stand up to any sort of criticism. Freeing because even in such a big pool, I don’t often encounter people who think about music-making in quite the same way that I do, and I came to realize that some people wanted to hear more of that approach as much as I like hearing other people’s approaches. Also, in such a big pool, there is freedom to <i>not </i>cover certain bases that I would otherwise feel had to be covered. For example. I don’t have to meet a quota of harsh noise because enough people are doing it better than I would. <b>And</b> <b>those people are open-minded enough that they welcome me into their worlds.</b></p>
<p>Diego: You once mentioned to me that in free improvisation sessions where groups would be formed at random, the ones that attracted you the most were the ones in which the musicians would not try to meet each other in a middle-ground but rather, would emphasize their differences, which resulted either in drawing the other musicians into their “language” or having multiple contrasting styles sounding and interacting simultaneously. Could you elaborate more on this idea?</p>
<p>Matt: This is absolutely something that falls in the realm of “one person’s opinion”, and perhaps it’s a hard thing to explain.<b> One of the main reasons I like experimental &amp; improvised music is that it brings out the individuality of the musicians involved.</b> In most of my experiences, those personalities show most in solo contexts, or one in which a musician is a band leader. Going back to the pond analogy, they would all be in different places of the pond.</p>
<p>Several years ago, I became involved with the idea of organizing sound-shifts &#8211; large scale music festivals where 60 to 100 musicians perform in overlapping shifts. (<a href="http://www.johnberndt.org/" target="_blank">The idea was originated by John Berndt in Baltimore.</a>) Over the course of 3 festivals in 3 years. I came to hear lots of sets where musicians were playing together for the first time. In many of the cases these musicians (myself included) sportfully find a middle ground which avoids many of the sonic hallmarks of where they originally came from. (Is this non-idiomatic improvisation?) Anyway, after hearing so many sets of this middle ground I came to miss all the other areas of the pond that weren’t being played. <b>Sometimes in a great set, one of the musicians sticks to their comfort zone and the other musicians walk all the way over and meet them there. Or all the musicians decide together to go into a strange new place that’s new for all of them.</b> I think that either of these strategies usually requires a bit discussion amongst the musicians beforehand.<b> Maybe I shouldn’t say I don’t like the middle, but I don’t want to hear only the middle.</b></p>
<p>Diego: <b>And going back to the metaphor of the pond which I find to be quite a fortunate one. I think that we could speak of a scene as an ecosystem where different musicians are fulfilling different roles, and each occupying their own niche.</b> Then what becomes important is the way in which each species interacts with the other, and how certain events in the ecosystem open paths through which others might feel compelled to evolve. If we look at it that way, your interest in the resources of the drum machine, as you mentioned before, would be an effect of that. This leads me to believe that it is of the interest of all musicians to keep their ecosystem as dynamic and healthy as possible, to enhance interactivity and the participation of their fellows.</p>
<p>Matt: I think you nailed it pretty well. I would add that I think it’s up to the individuals to determine the best direction to take their craft. I consume a lot more recorded music than live music, so<b> I think the best thing people can do for a healthy pond is to figure out what unique things they can contribute to music, and learn to get those messages across well. </b></p>

<h2><span id="promoting">[Being A Promoter In The Creative Music Community]</span></h2>
<p>Diego: You have also been <a href="/interviews/rent-romus-on-the-san-franciscos-bay-area-experimental-music-scene-and-curating-a-music-series/" target="_blank">an active promoter in the creative music community, co-curating the Luggage Store Gallery Series, along with Rent Romus</a>, as well as a the <a href="http://www.sfemf.org/"> San Francisco Electronic Music Festival</a>. Even more,<a href="http://ribosomematt.podomatic.com/" target="_blank"> you host a Podcast called World of Wonder</a> and <a href="http://ribosomemusic.tumblr.com/">you have a blog (Ribosome, Appreciation For Unusual Sounds) where you post short reviews of music from other musicians that interests you. </a>Can you tell us about this? What led you to doing all this work for the music community local and worldwide, and why is it important?</p>
<p>Matt: Let’s start with the live shows:</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, when I first came to this music scene, I was expecting to hear a lot of electronic sound design stuff. While the scene I encountered was very welcoming, <b>I started organizing events to try to create opportunities for musicians that I identified with.</b> <b>Many of these were concept-based performances that emphasized a combination of electronic and acoustic sounds.</b> I also organized events where the musicians would play or sample found objects brought in by the audience, or 40+ musicians would collaborate in a 4 hour drone music piece, or Pmocatat Ensemble &#8211; an ensemble where the artists performed with CDs and tape recordings of their instruments, rather than the instruments themselves.</p>
<p>Rent Romus needed some help in running the Luggage Store series, so he asked me to join in 2003. The San Francisco Electronic Music Festival staff included many people who had worked with me, and they liked that I was good at organizing events. That’s kind o<b>f a tip for musicians who want to get involved with those sorts of arts organizations: Local arts organizations are often on the lookout for people like that: Start putting together a few shows at different venues where it’s not just about getting a gig for your own band, and they’ll probably take notice. </b></p>
<p><b>Anyway, as I grew as an artist and curator over the years, the desire to do these concept-based performances subsided. Rather than try to make musicians play by my rules, I became more interested in hearing what their own rule sets were. </b></p>
<p>Diego: Those ideas are beautiful and inspiring, plus they give a the feeling of a once in a lifetime experience. Anyways they are very attractive and make me want to compile an encyclopedia of improvisational games (or how would you call them?)</p>
<p>Matt: Not sure where you to point you for more information about concept-based performances. I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s a general agreed-upon term.</p>
<p>But &#8220;Game pieces&#8221; are live music improvisational compositions that set up certain sets of rules for musicians interacting with each other. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy5et-D4uyo" target="_blank">The most famous is &#8220;Cobra&#8221; by John Zorn.</a></p>
<p>Diego: That&#8217;s interesting, seems like I have a new topic for research.  Anyways, about curation, what is your approach to it? (Criteria, procedures, etc.)</p>
<p>Matt: At Luggage Store, probably 60% of the booking comes from people contacting us. We’re definitely open to hearing from new people. <b>We’re proud to not be one of those places where you have to be well known or have an audience of x number of people before you can get a gig. We try to keep some open spaces on our calendar for musicians we haven’t heard of to contact us. </b>Other than that, I try to keep an ear to the ground for who is actively playing but hasn’t played our series in a while, or who has just released a CD, and I try to send them invites. Admittedly I’m not terribly good at staying on top of everything, so<b> I hope people will contact us.</b></p>

<p>Matt: I just recently started releasing my own CDs. While trying to compile a list of radio and review contacts, my strategy was to find who I liked who were at about my fame level (which is not very much), and find blogs where their music was being discussed. For some of these musicians, I found their music was being reviewed or independently promoted on one or two blogs. So I decided I’d try to be another avenue where they might be heard of. Blogging is a fairly new world for me. I still have no idea whether I’m doing it right or not, but I’m hesitant to become one of those blogs that reviews every CD that comes my way.</p>
<p>Diego: Why did you start a Podcast?</p>
<p>Matt: As I mentioned earlier, I listen to a lot more CDs than live concerts. I love to hear what an artist does when they have the opportunity to get everything just the way they want it. In the same way that the Luggage Store series supports live musicians, I wanted to create some forum where the completed recordings could be heard. I originally planned to put out only a few podcasts a year, but soon KUSF in Exile asked me to put on a regular show. I did for as long as I could, but since it takes me at least 6 hours to put together a 2 hour program, I couldn’t keep up. I still like doing it though. I’m trying to put out at least one episode per month.<br />
(http://ribosomematt.podomatic.com/)</p>
<p>Diego: Which medium has proven to be more engaging for the audience?</p>
<p>Matt: It’s hard to tell. At the Luggage Store, I can see who comes to each show and talk to them. That’s the most immediately rewarding.</p>
<p>With the podcast, there are about 5 or 6 people in the community who have told me that they follow them. That’s a good thing, because otherwise I probably would’ve given up on it. I was surprised to see that it’s been averaging at about 50 listeners per episode. I often search for experimental music podcasts, so I imagine new similarly-minded people must land on mine every once in a while.</p>
<p>With the blog, that’s still a shot in the dark right now. I have no idea whether people read experimental music blogs or not. If so, who are they? Are they people looking for new music, or artists searching for places where their CD was reviewed?<br />
<b>The blog and the podcast both aim to support the “global-local” community of experimental music. </b>Before the internet, such a community probably only existed between frequently-touring musicians. Now “local” is a level of renown as much as a geographical term. “Local” musicians can easily make their music as available as Kanye West’s.<b> We just need more pointers online that say, “If you like this, then you’ll probably also like this!”</b></p>

<h2><span id="success">[What Makes An Experimental Musician Successful?]</span></h2>
<p>Diego: Through your experience with <a href="/interviews/rent-romus-on-the-san-franciscos-bay-area-experimental-music-scene-and-curating-a-music-series/" target="_blank">the Bay Area’s experimental music scene,</a> either playing, curating, or promoting music in way or another. Which are the qualities that you have observed that have an influence on the success of a musician?</p>
<p>There are certain elements that I think point to a successful musical artist. <strong>By “successful” I mean that I think their records are good, whether or not I personally like them.</strong> Also, the <strong>musicians who have found fame and honest financial success</strong> seem to usually have these qualities:</p>
<ul>
<li>The artist knows what they’re about: They’ve figured out <strong>what they uniquely add</strong> to the large and varied pond that is their art form.</li>
<li>And they’ve figured out <strong>how to communicate and share that</strong>: In practice, they’ve probably focused on distilling their uniqueness rather than trying to catch up with the expectations of their field. They’re probably not the ones who are trying to sound like other artists. In this way, I also think it’s better to specialize in one or a relatively small number of niches than try to be a “jack of all trades”.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the pop artist Beck is a good idea of what I’m trying to get at here. Beck has worked in a number of genres over the years, but in most of his records I feel he’s never stopped sounding like himself. He’s worked hard to be good at what he does, but if he had spent all that time trying to polish himself up to be the most talented or most perfect musician, I don’t think people would’ve detected a musical personality to attach to.</p>
<p>In the experimental world, just about all the most successful or famous musicians I can name are loved for the distinct things they brought to the table.<img class="  aligncenter wp-image-142 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/matt_bw_300.jpg" alt="Matt Davignon's Drum Machine Rig" width="484" height="344" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/matt_bw_300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/matt_bw_300-135x96.jpg 135w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px" /></p>

<h2><span id="recommendations">[Recommendations]</span></h2>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>I could recommend musicians for days. <a href="http://ribosomematt.podomatic.com/" target="_blank">For the best recommendations, I’d suggest listening to my podcast.</a> However, for artists that I strongly identify with:</p>
<p><a href="https://oval.bandcamp.com/album/dok" target="_blank">Oval has been very good at taking sounds apart and reconstructing them into beautiful, flawed new forms.</a> I recommend the album “Dok” as a starting place.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmIQ7ansrA0">Coil made exceptional experimental music </a>(often but not always in a sort of abstract/electronic“post” offshoot from industrial pop music) from the early 80s to the mid 2000s. My favorite record is 1996’s “Black Light District”</p>
<p>I probably wouldn’t sound close to what I do now had I not picked up the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAeVT4tmybs" target="_blank">Jon Hassell/Brian Eno record “4th World Possible Musics”</a> as a teenager. Hassell has created a very unique electronically-inflected personality on his trumpet.</p>
<p>Another big teenage influence was<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nOtaijzlb0" target="_blank"> Klaus Schulze, who was one of those guys who would play 20 minute science fiction epics as a live solo act on synths, organs and tape machines.</a> Very much in the vein of many other artists at the time such as Tangerine Dream. Pick something from the mid 70s and it will probably be a nice listen.</p>
<p>I’ve enjoyed most of what I’ve heard on the <a href="http://www.runegrammofon.com/" target="_blank">Rune Grammofon label out of Norway,</a> including <a href="https://soundcloud.com/rune-grammofon" target="_blank">Alog, Phonophani, Deathprod, Humcrush, Huntsville, Supersilent, and Information.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMtXaRUMFjg" target="_blank">Steve Roden makes music that’s rather similar to mine, though often made from sampling sounds of found objects. </a>His is often a bit quieter, more beautiful, and much more patient. My favorite of his is called “Light Forms”.</p>
<p>Things that have been influential for your art:</p>
<h3>Book(s) / Film(s) / Artist(s)</h3>
<p>It wouldn’t be honest to to say that these have been directly influential to my music. Sometimes something makes me feel quiet, reflective, or awe-struck in a certain way that I’ll want to share, but it feels like it’s the emotion that’s the influence.</p>
<h3>Idea(s)</h3>
<p>There are a few ideas that have been influences. Nature gives me ideas often: bird calls, the sound of things moving in the wind, the sounds of human and animal vocalization and socialization…<br />
Another one was the experience of coming of age musically with limited equipment. My first looping/sampling devices did not record things in perfect 4/4 loops. Once I gained that ability, I still preferred the irregular sounds. So I often build loops now that have similar timing hiccups.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A (Hypothethical) Definition Of Experimentation In Music, The Arts And Science</h2>
<p>To be an experimentalist is to be searching. To search for something specific that has not yet been found, to be prey of a urge to explore and discover, to be looking for a thing unspecified, a ghost, a colored smoke, always that which is certainly ineffable. Often what one searches for only becomes clear in the course of the search itself. It could be said that the object of an exploration only gains reality through the real encounters with whatever crosses our path within the time frame in which we are creating. To explore is to be involved in an interaction, it is to touch with blind eyes, to listen without knowledge of what, it is almost rarely seeing, unless it means, looking at something indescribable like a cloud, more likely it is like a wonderfully improbable event, a bird landing on your window only to sing for you (a “for me!?” magical moment).</p>
<p>One never knows fully what is that other that is interacting with me. Is it merely an object? A passive substance that can be manipulated at will? Or is it rather more like a subject, producing it’s own peculiar effects upon us, having a life, a history of it’s own? Then the object seems to become only a simple invention, yet it reveals to us as something else. The act of exploration shows that that which is explored is for us more like the possibility of an object, rather than a fully determined and knowable object.<b> To experiment, in a sense, puts question marks on the whole of our sense of realit</b><strong>y</strong> by pointing out that that which we once recognized as “real” and “defined” is stranger than we thought, and becomes even more unknown the further we explore it.</p>
<h2>The Otherworldly And The Root Of Ingenuity</h2>
<p>And for all the otherworldliness that experimentation seems to imply, there is probably nothing more simple and, even, worldly. To be experimental is not only the nature of artists, scientists, designers, and problem solvers but also of children. That is why the ingenuity of creators and the ingenuousness of children have the same root, as being ingenuous, unsuspecting and inexperienced, is to be actually open to new experiences and to take experience as a truth to live by (even if in the long run it needs to be corrected).</p>
<p>In the same sense, in order to create, as an experimental musician, artist, or even as scientist one needs to be open to new ideas, and to new ways of looking at the world, it means to take new truths (hypothesis) and to live and work by them, to put them to a test and to discover their full implications. The world as we make sense of it is the product of an exploration, and almost paradoxically, the otherworldliness that the experimental ways of living and doing uncover to us is nothing more than an expansion of worldliness, of the world as we previously knew it. Otherworldliness is the world (re)discovered.</p>

<h2>The Challenges Of Creativity: Discovery And Returning To The Known</h2>
<p>To discover is perhaps one of the greatest joys of the experimental creator. Discovering or finding, is the achievement of something that serves as a found-ation. A place to build, a base to return and explore further, a shelter for the night. It is much necessary to get relatively established, if only provisionally, to have a small piece of territory, as the philosopher Manuel Delanda would say, in reference to Deleuze: “One should always keep a small piece of territory, always come back to that solid rock in order not to lose touch with reality. Too loose or too rigid rules will not produce anything interesting… &#8216;organizing chaos&#8217; can only happen in the middle of extremes.”</p>
<p>Thus we can see clearly the challenges of creation and as such, of being experimental. On one side, <i>to be open to the otherworldly</i>, which is an almost childlike and somewhat risky manner of being worldy. Loosing the world to have it returned changed. On the other side, to explore is to move whilst being in need of a base camp, a provisional territory. There is always the temptation stay safely in a piece of “new” found land, to not abandon the first achievements. It is even necessary to establish in a territory, but how long, no one can tell.  Creation is full of paradoxes, being otherworldy is the most worldly thing to do, and being in possession of a territory and periodically returning to it is a condition for exploration. Yet being too worldly or territorial will lead us away from experimentation and the joys and excitement of discovery and adventure.</p>
<h2>There Is Truly Much To Be Found</h2>
<p>We need only to sidestep from our certainties to find ourselves in a new uncertain place full of possibilities for artistic or scientific creation.  And as paradoxical as life and experimentation can be, and they go always hand in hand, we can then have the certainty of a wavering reality, and the firm conviction of the instability of what once was thought to be “the way things were”.</p>
